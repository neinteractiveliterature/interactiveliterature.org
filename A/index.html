<article class="conventionDescription">
<p>The first three New England Intercons were sponsored by the Interactive
Literature Foundation (ILF). It was time for a local organization, and so 
<a href="../NEIL/index.html">NEIL</a> was born. There was also a question of 
what to call the con given the new sponsorship. There were several ideas, but 
using letters seemed different and interesting. Thus, Intercon A was born.</p>
<p>Intercon A's attendance suffered a little given a last minute snowstorm.
Those of us who made it to the con didn't mind being snowed into a great set of
games.</p>

<h3><a name="airplane">Airplane 2: The Plane That Shagged Me (Or How I Learned
To Stop Worrying And Love the Plane)</a></h3>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chay Casso, Ken Clary, and Ricky Leiserson<br />
<b>Players:</b> 31</p>
<p>Space - the final cliche. These are the voyages of the Starship Airplane. Its
6-hour mission: To explore bellybutton lint, to breathe new life into hackneyed
jokes, to boldly parody where everyone else has parodied before. Set on the
first commercial shuttle flight from Moonbase Beta to Marsbase Alpha, Airplane 2
is a one-night, two-room game, run previously in October, 1999 under the
auspices of the MIT Assassins' Guild. A game of parody, adventure, intrigue, and
silliness. And Famous People. And spies. And weirdness. And religious endeavors.
And a young woman's struggle with gangrene (mustn't forget that part).
<i>Airplane 2</i> is written and run by Chay Casso, Ken Clary, and Ricky
Leiserson. Unfortunately, we cannot tell you what the Airplane is, you have to
experience it for yourself.</p>

<h3><a name="appalachian">Appalachian Wedding</a></h3>
<p><b>Author:</b> Ben Llewellyn<br />
<b>Players:</b> 18-30</p>
<p>Blood Mountain, West Virginia, 1932. The Wilkeses and the Booths are
celebrating(?) the marriage of Hattie and Mac. Maybe the wedding will even
happen! Come join the happy couple in this special day of love.</p>
<p>This must be a big day. Even State Senator Bubby Crowe is here to mark the
occasion. Heck, even Mickey Wilkes, the war hero who stayed in Paris and became
a poet is here, and he was here just a few months ago, for his little sister's
funeral. Today would be the perfect day, if only Preacher Wylie had survived
that ambush...</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: Love will be simulated by patty-cake.</p>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="byog_runtime">Build Your Own Game Runtime</a></h3>
<p><b>Facilitator:</b> Kelly Diane MacDougal<br />
<b>Players:</b> 12-30</p>
<p>Come play a never-before-seen game, written in a weekend! Players will
experience the results of a panel of sleep-deprived writers who met for the
first time on Friday night, commited to writing a game in 36 short hours. Expect
anything and everything in a game whose every detail is unknown until the con
starts...</p>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="byog">Build Your Own Game Workshop</a></h3>
<p><b>Facilitator:</b> Kelly Diane MacDougal<br />
<b>Players:</b> 12-30</p>
<p>This is an active participation workshop. Members will come up with the game
concept and outline during the scheduled planning phase. Then under the guidance
of an experienced writer and GM (Trust me, I'm a professional) you and the other
participants will craft the game over the course of the weekend and debut it on
Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Everyone is encouraged to participate in the planning meeting. You may come
and suggest ideas without committing to the actual game writing and then join us
to see the result. Those who decide to hang on through the whole process will
most likely lose some sleep, but hey it's a con. You will be free to play a game
or two on Saturday, all I ask is that those who want to help write and run
devote at least one full game slot to the writing process.</p>
<p>No experience is necessary only enthusiasm. All necessary production
materials will be provided by the moderator, including a computer (probably my
laptop). This has always been a fun workshop in the past, with many of the games
going on to successful runs elsewhere after some fine-tuning. Come and be part
of the creative experience without it interfering in your 'real' life.</p>

<h3><a name="city">City of Flashlights</a></h3>
<p><b>Author:</b> Suzanne Miller, Moira Parham, Jeannie Whited<br />

Texas, <i>City of Flashlights</i> is a spoof of the vampire genre from the GMs
who brought you <i>City of Light</i>.</p>

engineer look worried? '...where a trained and friendly Imagineerium starship
cruiseline crewmember will help you...' Did you hear that thump? COLLISION
IMMINENT! What do you mean I can't get another Rigellian Core Meltdown to go?
What am I supposed to drink while I wait? Is the air getting thin in here?

event of an actual evacuation...' COLLISION IMMINENT! Will an officer please
report to the Leo Deck? Daddy? Do you know where my Daddy is? 'Please do not

<h3><a name="dutchess">The Dutchess of Enslo</a></h3>
<p><b>Author:</b> MaryAlyce Rensa<br />
<b>Players:</b> 8-16</p>
<p>The Dutchess lost her husband 5 years ago to a shipping accident. She always
suspected foul play but never had proof. She devoted her energy into her magicks
and has become a rather powerful wizard. Learning her true nature caused her to
search for a rare artifact, that was broken down into three pieces. She has one,
knew of the second and just recently was able to negotiate a "trade" for the
item. Then she learned where the third piece was, and that has become a problem.
Her arch nemesis of hers and her husbands, of many years, has the precious
treasure. Now she has to use all her skills to reach her goals, and still not
hurt any of the loyal citizens of her domain. They loved her for many years, but
will they still love her if they knew who she really was?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Duke rose to power by killing his predecessor. He then desired
to expand his domain, and cleverly killed his rival neighbor Duke in a freak
shipping accident. However, he didn't count on the widowed Dutchess to be so
good with politics and with the people. Her being a wizard just complicated the
problem even more. But he studied her well, and knows what all wizards love.
Magicks. He silently began to hoard some of the rarest treasures of magicked
items, while he continued to spread rumors of her disloyality to her people, and
her inappropriate use of domain funds. And all of a sudden, she invites "him" to
her domain, as a guest. Now was the time for him to strike. He waited all his
Dukedom career for this chance, and he wasn't going to blow it.</p>
<p>Who will reach his/her goal, and will the loyal citizens be the ones to 
suffer?</p>

<h3><a name="house">House Meeting!</a></h3>
<p><b>Author:</b> Kreg Segall<br />
<b>Players:</b> 10</p>
<p>What happens what seven strangers are picked to live in a house to find out
what happens when people stop being polite and start being real? Join us in the
well-decorated but tense living room of a popular MTV show on a typical
episode.</p>
<p>There may be fights, sulking, and teen angst, but in the end you can be sure
that the housemates will learn just a little bit about themselves, all to a cool
soundtrack. The small cast of characters will run the gamut from 'wildly
annoying' to 'endearingly annoying.'</p>
<p><i>House Meeting!</i> will be raucous and silly. There will be arguments, 
obvious product placement, and touching moments. Apply to be a housemate
today!</p>

<h3><a name="long">The Long, Cold Night</a></h3>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Newman and Beth Kelly<br />
<b>Players:</b> 10-20</p>
<p>Ebon night. Icy snow. A wind as sharp as a razor. A howl from outside. A
scream from inside. Nowhere to run. No idea what you're running from.</p>
<p>A weekend at a Utah ski lodge turns into a nightmare when a blackout, an
unexpected blizzard, and a man-eating monster come together to trap the guests
and staff inside. But is what's outside worse than the horrors inside the lodge?
This is an intense psychological thriller aimed at adults. Mature themes and
subject matter abound. Minors may play, but we're not responsible for their lack
of sleep afterwards.</p>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="man">The Man In Black</a></h3>
<p><b>Author:</b> Brian Williams<br />
<b>Players:</b> 23-36</p>
<p>Most people come to Jericho-4 to get away from the long reach of the United
Federation of God. They form an odd collection of dissidents, free-thinkers and
criminals, all united in a desire for a quiet life...</p>
<p>Then someone hired the galaxy's most infamous assassin, The Man in Black, to
carry out a hit on Jericho-4. No-one knows who the target is, but The Man in
Black has attracted a large following: The Man in Black Groupies, dedicated
watchers of the great man's hits, Secret Agents of all forms and persuasions,
Law Enforcement Officers and all the sorts of people you don't want in a place
like Jericho...</p>

man himself, and word has it the hit is going to be tonight. Will you be a
Local, just hoping for a quiet life, or an outsider, come to help or hinder The

exactly the wrong time to visit Jericho-4...</p>

friends. Bring your horses, bring your pets. But most of all bring your money.

<h3><a name="night">A Night at the Four Aces</a></h3>
<p><b>Authors:</b> John Corrado, Jr., Stephanie Olmstead-Dean and Gordon
Olmstead-Dean<br />
<b>Players:</b> 20-42</p>
<p>Gangsters, Spats, Flappers, Bootleggers, Hooch, Cards, Horses, Fast Boats,
Big Cars, Aeroplanes, and Jazz in 1929!</p>
<p>It is 1929. America has never been more prosperous. Despite Prohibition,
'dry' America thirsts for hooch. Moonshine is manufactured in the mountains, and
green beer in the cellars of Chicago, but the best illegal booze is the real
stuff, brought in from Canada, where no liquor laws apply. Gangsters and
smugglers work to keep America wet!</p>
<p>Lakeshore, Ohio is situated perfectly for smugglers. Located between
Cleveland and Chicago on the Great Lakes, the town has a harbor and a civil
airfield. Downtown, everyone's favorite nightspot is the Four Aces. This is the
story of that club, and of some of the people whose lives crossed there.</p>

<h3><a name="play">The Play's the Thing</a></h3>
<p><b>Author:</b> Tom Russell<br />
<b>Players:</b> 6-10</p>
<p>In 2148, the UN CHRONOS Project uncovers evidence of an unknown, unpublished
play by William Shakespeare. A golden opportunity for the organization, a
mission to the past to recover the play is authorized. Due to the nature of Time
Travel, the top Shakespearean actors in the world are recruited to travel back
in time, assume the identities of Shakespeare's troupe and perform the play
before King James himself.</p>
<p>Join an historic expedition to the past to recover and perform this lost play
by Shakespeare! A very freeform LARP for players looking for a serious
challenge. Some knowledge of Shakespeare and actual theatrical experience very
helpful. Contact Tom Russell for more details.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: Players will be expected to improvise a performance piece before 
an audience.</p>

<h3><a name="toytanic">Toytanic - The Final Voyage of the Beary Celeste</a></h3>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kelly Diane MacDougal and Jim MacDougal<br />
<b>Players:</b> 8-19</p>
<p>The Beary Celeste is a boat used to take underprivileged and sick kids for
sailing/fishing trips. Every child receives a toy when they come on board. You
are those toys. Unfortunately hurricane Bambi caused the ships lines to snap and
you are adrift in the Atlantic. There are no humans on board and you must find a
way to get yourselves rescued.</p>
<p>Rescue isn't as easy as it sounds. While Captain Jimmy the frog and his crew,
Nurse Christine and Fred Bear, are capable of sailing the boat, humans would
notice a bunch of toys walking around and talking. You must find some other way.
Things are complicated by that loud Mr. Snipper, and that stupid dinosaur keeps
running around yelling his head off. Perhaps if everyone would just shut up and
let you think, you would be able to figure it all out.</p>

<h3><a name="unexpected">The Unexpected Storm</a></h3>
<p><b>Author:</b> David C. Helms<br />
<b>Players:</b> 20-25</p>
<p>You and your traveling companions were done for, until you spotted the Inn.
Blessed warmth, a glowing fire, and good food did much to restore you, and now
your brain begins to slowly turn. Why an Inn, here, in this desolate mountain
pass? Why so many other travelers, in said pass? What do they want? Why are they
here? What is that strange creature crawling around under the tables? Is that a
Wizard, over there? What brings a master of magic to this place? And surely that
is a Paladin, in the glowing suit of armor? What evil does that one hunt, in
this cozy Inn? That one there, between the two guards, must be a nobleman, he's
simply dripping in wealth.</p>

hidden, but waiting for you. It was nothing, just a passing fancy. Still, must
remember to check my room for hidden panels...</p>

breaks, you are stuck with each other, and this Inn.</p>
