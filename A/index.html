<h3 align="center">Intercon A</h3>
<p>The first three New England Intercons were sponsored by the InteractiveLiterature Foundation (ILF). It was time for a local organization, and so<a href="../NEIL/index.html">NEIL</a> was born. There was also a question of whatto call the con given the new sponsorship. There were several ideas, but using letters seemed different and interesting. Thus, Intercon A was born.</p>

<p>Intercon A's attendance suffered a little given a last minute snowstorm.Those of us who made it to the con didn't mind being snowed into a great setof games.</p>

<h3><i><a name="airplane">Airplane 2: The Plane That Shagged Me (Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love the Plane)</a></i></h3>
<p><b>Authors:&nbsp;</b>Chay Casso, Ken Clary, and Ricky Leiserson<br><b>Players:&nbsp;</b>31</p>

<p>Space - the final cliche. These are the voyages of the Starship Airplane. Its 6-hour mission: To explore bellybutton lint, to breathe new life into hackneyed jokes, to boldly parody where everyone else has parodied before. Set on the first commercial shuttle flight from Moonbase Beta to Marsbase Alpha, Airplane 2 is a one-night, two-room game, run previously in October, 1999 under the auspices of the MIT Assassins' Guild. A game of parody, adventure, intrigue, and silliness. And Famous People. And spies. And weirdness. And religious endeavors. And a young woman's struggle with gangrene (mustn't forget that part). Airplane 2 is written and run by Chay Casso, Ken Clary, and Ricky Leiserson. Unfortunately, we cannot tell you what the Airplane is, you have to experience it for yourself.

<h3><i><a name="appalachian">Appalachian Wedding</a></i></h3>

<p>Blood Mountain, West Virginia, 1932. The Wilkeses and the Booths are celebrating(?) the marriage of Hattie and Mac. Maybe the wedding will even happen! Come join the happy couple in this special day of love.</p>

<p>This must be a big day. Even State Senator Bubby Crowe is here to mark the occasion. Heck, even Mickey Wilkes, the war hero who stayed in Paris and became a poet is here, and he was here just a few months ago, for his little sister's funeral. Today would be the perfect day, if only Preacher Wylie had survived that ambush...</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: Love will be simulated by patty-cake.

<h3><i><a name="byog_runtime">Build Your Own Game Runtime</a></i></h3>
<p><b>Facilitator:&nbsp;</b>Kelly Diane MacDougal<br><b>Players:&nbsp;</b>12-30</p>

<p>Come play a never-before-seen game, written in a weekend! Players will experience the results of a panel of sleep-deprived writers who met for the first time on Friday night, commited to writing a game in 36 short hours. Expect anything and everything in a game whose every detail is unknown until the con starts...

<h3><i><a name="byog">Build Your Own Game Workshop</a></i></h3>
<p><b>Facilitator:&nbsp;</b>Kelly Diane MacDougal<br><b>Players:&nbsp;</b>12-30</p>

<p>This is an active participation workshop. Members will come up with the game concept and outline during the scheduled planning phase. Then under the guidance of an experienced writer and GM (Trust me, I'm a professional) you and the other participants will craft the game over the course of the weekend and debut it on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Everyone is encouraged to participate in the planning meeting. You may come and suggest ideas without committing to the actual game writing and then join us to see the result. Those who decide to hang on through the whole process will most likely lose some sleep, but hey it's a con. You will be free to play a game or two on Saturday, all I ask is that those who want to help write and run devote at least one full game slot to the writing process.</p>

<p>No experience is necessary only enthusiasm. All necessary production materials will be provided by the moderator, including a computer (probably my laptop). This has always been a fun workshop in the past, with many of the games going on to successful runs elsewhere after some fine-tuning. Come and be part of the creative experience without it interfering in your 'real' life.

<h3><i><a name="dutchess">The Dutchess of Enslo</a></i></h3>
<p><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>MaryAlyce Rensa<br><b>Players:&nbsp;</b>8-16</p>

<p>The Dutchess lost her husband 5 years ago to a shipping accident. She always suspected foul play but never had proof. She devoted her energy into her magicks and has become a rather powerful wizard. Learning her true nature caused her to search for a rare artifact, that was broken down into three pieces. She has one, knew of the second and just recently was able to negotiate a "trade" for the item. Then she learned where the third piece was, and that has become a problem. Her arch nemesis of hers and her husbands, of many years, has the precious treasure. Now she has to use all her skills to reach her goals, and still not hurt any of the loyal citizens of her domain. They loved her for many years, but will they still love her if they knew who she really was?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Duke rose to power by killing his predesessor. He then desired to expand his domain, and cleverly killed his rival neighbor Duke in a freak shipping accident. However, he didn't count on the widowed Dutchess to be so good with politics and with the people. Her being a wizard just complicated the problem even more. But he studied her well, and knows what all wizards love. Magicks. He silently began to hoard some of the rarest treasures of magicked items, while he continued to spread rumors of her disloyality to her people, and her inappropriate use of domain funds. And all of a sudden, she invites "him" to her domain, as a guest. Now was the time for him to strike. He waited all his Dukedom career for this chance, and he wasn't going to blow it.</p>

<p>Who will reach his/her goal, and will the loyal citizens be the ones to suffer?

<h3><i><a name="toytanic">Toytanic - The Final Voyage of the Beary Celeste</a></i></h3>
<p><b>Authors:&nbsp;</b>Kelly Diane MacDougal and Jim MacDougal<br><b>Players:&nbsp;</b>8-19</p>

<p>The Beary Celeste is a boat used to take underprivileged and sick kids for sailing/fishing trips. Every child receives a toy when they come on board. You are those toys. Unfortunately hurricane Bambi caused the ships lines to snap and you are adrift in the Atlantic. There are no humans on board and you must find a way to get yourselves rescued.</p>

<p>Rescue isn't as easy as it sounds. While Captain Jimmy the frog and his crew, Nurse Christine and Fred Bear, are capable of sailing the boat, humans would notice a bunch of toys walking around and talking. You must find some other way. Things are complicated by that loud Mr. Snipper, and that stupid dinosaur keeps running around yelling his head off. Perhaps if everyone would just shut up and let you think, you would be able to figure it all out.

<h3><i><a name="unexpected">The Unexpected Storm</a></i></h3>
<p><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>David C. Helms<br><b>Players:&nbsp;</b>20-25</p>

<p>You and your traveling companions were done for, until you spotted the Inn. Blessed warmth, a glowing fire, and good food did much to restore you, and now your brain begins to slowly turn. Why an Inn, here, in this desolate mountain pass? Why so many other travelers, in said pass? What do they want? Why are they here? What is that strange creature crawling around under the tables? Is that a Wizard, over there? What brings a master of magic to this place? And surely that is a Paladin, in the glowing suit of armor? What evil does that one hunt, in this cozy Inn? That one there, between the two guards, must be a nobleman, he's simply dripping in wealth.</p>

<p>That reminds you of the dream you had last night, a dream of great wealth, hidden, but waiting for you. It was nothing, just a passing fancy. Still, must remember to check my room for hidden panels...</p>

<p>A strange collection of people, in a slightly strange place. Until the storm breaks, you are stuck with each other, and this Inn.</p>
