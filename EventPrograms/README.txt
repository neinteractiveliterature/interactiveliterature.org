This where event programs should go, with appropriate names. If we have NELCO
programs, or other things, they should also go in here, which is why there's a
generic name. I'm putting this file here just so that I can push the new 
directory into the repo.

1. If we decide to add a new page to the site to collect all the programs, the
index.html file would go here. I don't think that's warranted yet. I would 
start with links from the actual con websites, as well as from the Intercon
convention page. (e.g. add a column with links that say "Program".)

2. When there are actual contents in this directory, let's nuke this file.
