<article>
<h1>What is LARP to us?</h1>
<p>Recently, people have tried to describe what an "Intercon LARP", "Intercon
style LARP", or a "theater style LARP" is, often with contradictory answers.
That's actually not surprising at all, because most people have a relatively
small set of samples that they are basing their definitions on. The terms
"Intercon style LARP" and "theater style" are often used interchangeably, even
though "theater style" is really a subset of "Intercon style LARP".</p>
<p>If you actually look at the LARPs that have run at the northern Intercons
alone, between Intercon the Thirteenth and Intercon N, there have been more than
<i>seven hundred and thirty</i> LARPs. Some of these have run more than once, or
are annual favorites like <i>The Other Other* All-Batman Game</i>, but that's
still means there are a <i>lot</i> of unique Intercon LARPs.</p>
<p>If you add in the LARPs of all of the other Intercons, outside of the modern
New England cons, the number soars even higher. The UK's <i>Consequences</i>
conventions may run British Freeforms, but they're also Intercon style LARPs.
They add even more to the total count. In New England, you also have to consider
the <i>Brandeis Festival of LARPs</i>, which has grown to surpass the size of
most of the southern Intercons. There's the <i>SLAW</i> conventions at WPI, and
<i>Dice Bubble</i> and <i>Time Bubble</i> conventions at RPI. There are more
regional conventions and more regional groups that also run Intercon style
LARPs, some of which show up at Intercon, or start there.</p>
<p>That doesn't even begin to consider the Intercon style LARPs that aren't run
at Intercon because of time and space constraints. They are LARPs that would be
entirely familiar to Intercon attendees, because they are written by many of the
same authors. They could run at Intercon, if Intercon had a nigh-infinite
budget.</p>
<p>That is an <i>astonishing</i> number of unique Intercon style LARPs.</p>
<p>To be sure, "Intercon style" LARPs is a terrible term, because it carries a
connection to the convention around with it, when that might not be true. Sure,
many current LARP writers may have gotten an inspiration to write their first
LARP from their experiences at Intercon, but there are others who wrote their
first "Intercon style" LARP long before they'd ever heard of Intercon. However,
for lack of a better term, we'll stick with "Intercon style" LARP for this
treatise...</p>
<p>So, what characteristics defines these kinds of LARPs?</p>
<p>Intercon style LARPs can run from a few minutes to an hour or two, to the
"typical" Intercon slot of four hours, to longer LARPs that still fit at
Intercon of six, eight and ten hours, or even the entire weekend. Originally
Intercon was nothing but weekend long LARPs; a schedule full of shorter games
was an evolutionary step that came later. Standalone theater style weekend LARPs
continue to run, such as <i>Lullaby of Broadway I, II, and III</i>, <i>Tales of
Pendragon</i>, <i>Tombstone</i> and many others. The MIT Assassins regularly run
ten day long theater style LARPs and have for years; they've been running LARPs
even before there was an Intercon. There have even been theater style LARP
campaigns. Many Mind's Eye Theater Vampire LARPs fall into this category, as
does <i>Dark Summonings</i> (Lovecraftian Horror), <i>Brassy's Men</i>
(Victorian steampunk), <i>To Be Continued</i> (genre mashup), and many many
more. All of these could easily run at Intercon, with an Intercon audience, if
Intercon had infinite time and space, and so fall into the "Intercon style"
category.</p>
<p>Intercon style LARPs can run with as few as three players and as many as
eighty or more.</p>
<p>Some Intercon style LARPs ask the players to write their own character
biographies. Some characters are created at the door, using workshops or some
other process. Some character sheets may be as small as three sentences, which
can be brilliant (<i>FOCUS</i>) or abysmal (<i>Slave Girls of the Terror
Dome</i>). Many character sheets are a page or two. There are others that span
ten or more pages. There are amnesia games where you don't have a character
sheet to start, and you may not remember who you are until some time in the
middle of the game, or not at all. There are Horde style LARPs and Tale Telling
LARPs where you play several characters during the span of the game. There are
even LARPs where you play a character who's playing a character in a LARP.</p>
<p>Characters in Intercon style LARPs can be human or not. There have been
android characters, robots, aliens, gods, rock stars, demons, angels, diplomats,
dead people, vampires, werewolves, fae, superheroes, superhero sidekicks, mental
patients, Time Lords, Jedi Knights, stuffed animals, Victorian detectives,
post-Singularity software, Dust Bunnies, Lego&trade; bricks, sentient elevators,
puppets, cats, and even a cat's hairball.</p>
<p>Players in Intercon style LARPs are asked to improvise their dialog, to
present character-written poetry, to sing, dance, and to <i>Shut Up and Play
Your Guitar</i>. There are Intercon style LARPs that call for rehearsed and
scripted dialog in places. <i>BABUL</i>, a LARP about prehistoric people, does
not allow any speech whatsoever.</p>
<p>Intercon style LARPs span every popular genre and then some, in murder
mysteries, in improv games, in period pieces, in fairy tales, in odd mashups, in
post-apocalyptic times, in musicals with singing, in hard science fiction set in
the far future, and in experimental games that defy description. And yes, there
are even some Intercon style LARPs set in medieval fantasy worlds.</p>
<p>Some Intercon style LARPs have simple mechanics. Some have complicated
mechanics. Some have no mechanics whatsoever. Some use dice, some use
rock/paper/scissors, some use simple math, some use card games, some use
computer devices, and some even use live combat and boffer weapons to resolve
combat, even in a "theater style" game. Some Intercon style LARPs are run by
live combat groups with boffer weapons, and so don't fall into the "theater
style" of play. Some Intercon style LARPs even use hotel furniture croquet to
simulate Internet network traffic.</p>
<p>Some Intercon style LARPs don't have any props. Some use item cards to
represent props. Some use actual physical items that you have to carry about and
don't fit into your pocket. Some have props with computer hardware in them, so
they react to the characters or the environment. Some have props you have to
disassemble in order to reassemble them as something new.</p>
<p>Some Intercon style LARPs call for no costuming, where you play in street
clothes. Some Intercon style LARPs are costumed with clothing scrounged from
thrift stores, or rented from costuming shops. Some ask for significant
costuming, where people will go all out to create amazing outfits. Some Intercon
style LARPs have even created uniforms for their casts.</p>
<p>Intercon style LARPs games can be played in a square taped to the floor of a
hotel room, in a hotel suite, in a hotel function space, at someone's home, on a
farm, at a house where they built a two story Mayan step pyramid to climb and a
rotating Stargate to walk through, at a campsite, in downtown Boston with people
unaware of the game all around them, in cars in a road rally across southern
Vermont, or in a real submarine. Sure, many of these couldn't possibly fit into
an actual Intercon convention, but they run and behave the same way as Intercon
style LARPs - again, it's a terrible term.</p>
<p>Some Intercon style LARPs have no additional material for the game. Some
LARPs use bluesheets or greensheets to detail common information shared by some
characters in the game. Some Intercon style LARPs have extensive websites filled
with background materials. Some Intercon style LARPs provide music and
lyrics.</p>
<p>Some Intercon style LARPs are run by a single Game Master (GM). Some LARPs
have entire teams of GMs to handle the game. Some Intercon style LARPs run
without any GMs. Some Intercon style LARPs call on players within the game to
make GM decisions for other players as needed.</p>
<p>Intercon looks for diverse styles of LARPs to present to players. Most fall
into the theater style subset of LARPs. There have been UK Freeform games at
Intercon, as well as American Freeform games, which are very different styles,
despite similar names. There have been NERO, Xanodria and other live combat
groups running events at Intercon. There have been Nordic and Jeepform games at
Intercon. There are LARPs that use classic methods and systems used by other
Intercon style LARPs and there are others that experiment and push the bounds of
what people think of as LARP.</p>
<p>LARP stands for Live Action Role Playing, in all its diverse forms and
flavors. That's what Intercon is looking for, and what represents an "Intercon
style LARP". You can't pin an Intercon style LARP down to some fixed set of
characteristics, because, in the long history of Intercon LARPs, there are
always exceptions that fall outside those generalizations. That's what makes
Intercon LARPs surprising, surprisingly diverse, and a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Now all we need is a better term to describe them.</p>
