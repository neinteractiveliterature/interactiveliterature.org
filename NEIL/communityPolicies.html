<h1>Community Policies</h1>
<p>We live in a diverse community, which we appreciate and treasure. We welcome
that diversity, and want to continue to encourage it. As we continue to grow and
welcome new people, we want to make it clear how NEIL operates.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Event Registration Policy</h2>
<p>NEIL events follow a strict first-come, first-serve policy when it comes to
event registrations.</p>
<p>The only exception to this policy is if there is some legal restriction that
should exclude a player from an event. For example, if an event is a boffer
combat game, there may be insurance reasons that require restrictions, such as
insurance waivers for pregnant women and players under the age of 16. In these
cases, it will be clear from the event description.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Harassment Policy</h2>
<p>NEIL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion,
or any other factor. We do not tolerate harassment of event attendees in any
form. Event attendees violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
the event without a refund at the discretion of the event organizers.</p>
<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related
to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. It also includes display
of sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of games or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, and
unwelcome simulated combat using realistic or non-realistic weapon props.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take
any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion
from the event with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone
else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of
the event Senior Staff immediately. Event Senior Staff can be identified by
their event badge, which will say SENIOR STAFF under their name, and, if they
are on duty, by an event Senior Staff button.</p>
<p>Event Senior Staff will be happy to help participants contact Hotel security
or local law enforcement if desired, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. Senior Staff
will never pressure anyone into making an official report. We value your safety,
privacy, and comfort while at a NEIL event.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Weapons Policy</h2>
<p>NEIL understands that costumes sometimes include weapons, and some
boffer games have simulated combat with boffer weapons, but the safety and
comfort of our attendees and other occupants of the hotel must be paramount. In
the context of this policy, "weapon prop" or "weapon-like prop" refers to any
prop that looks like a weapon, including but not limited to swords, knives,
guns, bats, clubs, claws, arrows, etc.</p>
<p>Any realistic-looking weapon prop must be peace-bonded and not wieldable.
Swords must be secured in their sheaths with string, zip-ties, or some other
method that actually prevents them from being drawn. If you need help
peace-bonding your weapon prop, you may bring it to the event staff. If event
staff concludes that your realistic-looking weapon prop cannot be peace-bonded,
you will be asked to return the prop to your hotel room or vehicle and leave it
there for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>Wieldable weapon props must be obviously fake and approved by the GMs. In
games that use boffer combat, only props approved for boffer combat by the GMs
may be used for this purpose. In other games, combat may be acted out as well as
being simulated with non-physical methods ONLY with the explicit permission of
all parties involved. Please note that explicit permission to act out a combat
does not automatically imply permission to touch another player or to contact
another player with your weapon prop.</p>
<p>Outside of games, any non-realistic weapon props must either be peace-bonded
or carried in a non-threatening manner (sheathed, pointed at the floor, or put
away). (Realistic weapon props must be peace-bonded at all times, as detailed
above).</p>
<p>Non-prop weapons are not allowed at NEIL events.</p>
<p>No realistic-looking gun props without orange safety tips are allowed at NEIL
events under any circumstances and should not be kept hidden while in public
areas.</p>
<p>Violation of any of these rules is grounds for immediate expulsion from NEIL
events, without refund. If you have any questions about acceptable weapon props,
ask at the Operations desk or contact the Event Chair or the Operations
coordinator.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Alcohol Policy</h2>
<p>Because of the hotel's liquor license and strict Massachusetts state law,
alcohol in function spaces may only be served by a bartender from the hotel.
Players and GMs may not bring their own alcohol into the function space. If a GM
would like to have a real bar for their event, we can make arrangements with the
hotel in advance. There is to be no alcohol in the Con Suite.</p>
<p>Players, GMs, or Games found in violation of this policy will be asked to
remove the alcohol from the function space immediately. If they do not comply,
they will be asked to leave the hotel. If the GMs opt to have a bartender, the
bartender will validate that the players are of legal drinking age.</p>
