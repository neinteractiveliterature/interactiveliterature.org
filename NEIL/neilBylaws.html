<ul class="neilBylawsAlphabeticList">
	<li>
		<p>Until such time as these By-Laws may be amended, the Board of
		Directors shall consist of not less than five nor more than ten persons,
		the exact number of which shall be determined by the existing Board of
		Directors at the annual meeting, in accordance with the reasonable needs
		of the corporation. The President of the corporation shall be a
		director. At any special or regular meeting the directors then in office
		may increase the number of directors and elect new directors to complete
		the number so fixed; or they may decrease the number of directors, but
		only to eliminate vacancies existing by reason of the death,
		resignation, removal or disqualification of one or more directors.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>In addition, the existing Board of Directors may at any time invite
		individuals to serve as non-voting advisory members of the Board of
		Directors for a term of one year, subject to reappointment at the
		pleasure of the voting members. The outgoing President shall be an
		advisory member of the Board for a term of one year, if not otherwise
		elected as a director.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h5>4.2: Tenure</h5>
<p>The President shall serve on the Board of Directors for a term of one year or
until a successor is elected and qualified, or until he/she sooner dies,
resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified. Other directors shall serve a two
year term of office. Such terms shall be staggered so that no more than half of
the terms of all Board members, not including the President, shall expire at any
one time. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall
hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected or until a
successor has been elected.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h5>4.3: Selection of Directors</h5>
<p>At the annual meeting each year, the disinterested directors shall, by
majority vote, elect the directors to fill the slots of terms that have expired
or are otherwise vacant. Nominations for such directors shall be submitted to
the President or Clerk of the corporation at least thirty (30) days prior to the
annual meeting. The President or Clerk will promptly notify the nominees of
their nomination. Such nominees may accept or decline the nomination. Those
accepting may, prior to the annual meeting, submit candidate statements to the
President or Clerk for consideration by the Board. Board members may serve one
or more terms in office. For purposes of these By-Laws, "disinterested
directors" shall mean those directors who are not the subject of the action to
be taken.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h5>4.4: Powers</h5>
<p>The affairs of the corporation shall be managed by the directors who shall
have and may exercise all the powers of the corporation.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h5>4.5: Committees</h5>
<p>The directors may elect or appoint one or more committees of the corporation.
The directors shall not designate their powers to these committees. Unless the
directors otherwise designate, committees shall conduct their affairs in the
same manner as is provided in these By-Laws for the directors. The members of
any committee shall remain in office at the pleasure of the directors.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h5>4.6: Removal</h5>
<p>A director may be removed with or without cause by vote by a majority of the
disinterested directors then in office. A director may be removed with cause
only after reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h5>4.7: Resignation</h5>
<p>A director may resign by delivering a written resignation to the President,
Treasurer or Clerk of the corporation, to a meeting of the directors or to the
corporation at its principal office. Such resignation shall be effective upon
receipt (unless specified to be effective at some other time) and acceptance
thereof shall not be necessary to make it effective unless it so states.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h5>4.8: Vacancies</h5>
<p>Vacancies on the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority vote of the
directors at any regular or special meeting. Each successor shall hold office
for the unexpired term or until he/she sonner dies, resigns, is removed or
becomes disqualified. The directors shall have and may exercise all their powers
notwithstanding the existence of one or more vancancies in their number.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h5>4.9: Restriction of Interested Directors</h5>
<p>No more than 49% of the persons serving on the Board of Directors at any time
may be interested persons. An "interested person" is any person being
compensated by the corporation for services rendered to it, whether as an
employee or independent contractor. Notwithstanding the above, any violation of
the provision of this paragraph shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of any transaction entered into by the corporation.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h5>4.10: Standards of Conduct for Directors</h5>
<p>Each member of the Board of Directors shall perform in good faith, in a
manner the director believes to be in the best interest of the corporation, and
with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as the reasonable prudent person
in a like position would use under similar circumstances. This standard shall
apply to the service of a director in his/her capacity as a member of a
committee, as well as in other respects, and to the selection of the directors
and officers.</p>
<ul>
	<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
	<h5>4.10.a: Reliance on others</h5>
	<p>Any director may rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements
	including financial statements presented or prepared by or under the
	supervision of the following entities, providing that the director in such
	reliance acts in good faith.</p>
	<ul class="neilBylawsRomanList">
		<li>
			<p>Officers or employees of the corporation who the director
			believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Counsel, independent accountants or other persons as to the
			matters believed to be within that person's professional or expert
			competence; or in the case of a director;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>A committee of the Board, upon which the director does not serve,
			as to matters within the designated authority which the director
			believes to merit confidence.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A director shall not be considered to be acting in good faith if he has
	the knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such
	reliance to be unwarranted.</p>
</ul>
