<h1>The NEIL Community and You</h1>
<p>You may already be a part of the NEIL Community. NEIL wants you to be part of
the NEIL Community, to have a say in future NEIL efforts and to help determine
the direction of NEIL. There are many people with an interest what NEIL does,
and we want to hear from the diversity of voices in our Community.</p>
<div class="NEILGoal">
	<p>You are a member of the NEIL Community if any of these are true:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>You have attended at least one NEIL sponsored event in the last 3
		years before the most recent NEIL Board election. At this point, this is
		either an Intercon convention or a NELCO convention.</p></li>
		<li><p>You have submitted an article to, or are on the staff of <i>Game
		Wrap</i> magazine.</p></li>
		<li><p>You have submitted a LARP to, or are on the staff of the LARP
		Library.</p></li>
	</ul>
</div>
<p>This definition will expand, as NEIL grows to sponsor more events and
publications.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4>Why Change?</h4>
<p>New England Interactive Literature, NEIL, was founded in 2000 as the legal
corporation needed to satisfy state and federal laws for running the New England
Intercon conventions. The NEIL corporation was designed with a small Board of
Directors, needed just to choose the next Intercon chair and to oversee the
greater operational business issues outside of Intercon. NEIL has come a long
way since then, with the growing list of projects found in the navigation menu
on the left side of this page. As this list has grown, so has the Community of
people involved in the production of these events, as well as the much larger
Community of people enjoying the results of these efforts.</p>
<p>The NEIL Board has always looked to the greater NEIL Community for ideas and
new projects. The Board is small, and the Community continues to grow, having
more than doubled in size since 2000. In order to better hear the diverse voices
and ideas in our growing Community, and to find the new volunteers that will run
the growing set of NEIL events and efforts of the future, the NEIL Board of
Directors adopted a new set of Community Outreach procedures in November
2015.</p>
<div class="NEILGoal">
	<p>We want <b>YOU</b> to be part of NEIL, with <b>YOUR</b> ideas and
	<b>YOUR</b> help. You can help NEIL grow LARPing throughout New England and
	beyond.</p>
</div>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4>Voting for Change: NEIL Community Meetings</h4>
<p>The NEIL Board of Directors is seeking input, opinions, and ideas from the
NEIL Community about elections, policy, and future directions, through regular,
open NEIL Community Meetings. NEIL Community Meetings will be held, as
necessary, to select members of the NEIL Board of Directors, the Chairs of
NEIL-sponsored events, and policy changes proposed by Members of the Community
and the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Proposals for policy changes and notification of elections will be announced
to the Community at least fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting at which votes
will be taken. The NEIL Board of Directors will make a best effort to
communicate this announcement to the Community through the
<a href="http://eepurl.com/bRbONb" target="signups">NEIL Community mailing</a>
list. These meetings will also be announced at NEIL events, and on the
<a href="communityMeetings.html">Upcoming Meetings</a> page.</p>
<p>During NEIL Community Meetings, Community Members will be polled for their
opinions on candidates for election, on policy proposals, and other Community
efforts. To participate in any NEIL Community Vote, a NEIL Community Member must
either be present at the meeting, be attending remotely via electronic means, or
send notification of proxy to the NEIL President or other officer as designated
by the NEIL Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The NEIL Board of Directors are responsible for determining if the Community
proposals fulfill the business and legal requirements necessary for the
continuing operation of the NEIL corporation. These are issues that the Board
will raise in the Community Meeting, when possible. For example, the NEIL budget
cannot possibly buy every member of the NEIL Community a Pony. The Board might
suggest instead that it would be possible for the Board to pay for 3x5 cards in
order to give a Pony Item Card to each Community Member.</p>
<p>After the NEIL Commmunity is polled on the issues before it, the NEIL Board
of Directors will meet, generally immediately afterwards. It is expected that
the Board will accept and formally ratify Community proposals by the
corporation, except in those rare cases where the proposal would violate the
NEIL Bylaws, state or federal law, or the laws of Thermodynamics.</p>
<p>Formal decisions made by the Board of Directors on Community proposals will
be announced at the conclusion of their meeting.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4>What Won't Change</h4>
<p>Operational decisions, policy implementation details, and business functions
required by <a href="neilBylaws.html">NEIL Bylaws</a>, state laws, and federal
laws, will remain the exclusive responsibility of the Board of Directors, event
chairs, and the editorial staff of <i>Game Wrap</i>, as appropriate. It is not
the intent to modify the Bylaws of the corporation. The Board of Directors will
continue to oversee the operation of the New England Interactive Literature
corporation, as required by the Bylaws. Specifically, NEIL is not changing to an
organization with a formal voting membership, with the logistical, legal, and
budgetary complications that would occur with such a change.</p>
<p>As the Community grows, there may be security issues involving harrassment or
worse. It is expected that event Security Staff and the Board of Directors will
handle these following the necessary legal and privacy requirements of all
involved. The Board will strive to be as transparent as possible in these
cases.</p>
<p>Formal decisions made by the Board of Directors on all of these topics will
be announced at the conclusion of their meeting.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4>Going Forward</h4>
<p>We expect that the NEIL Community Outreach procedures will evolve and change
over time, as the Community continues to grow and evolve.</p>
