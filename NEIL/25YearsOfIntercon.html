<h1>25 Years of Intercon</h1>
<div class="referenceNote">
	<p>This was originally an insert in the 
	<a href="http://www.interactiveliterature.org/J/index.php">Intercon J</a>
	program book. Intercon J happened in March 2010, which was during the 25th
	anniversary year of the Intercon convention. At Intercon J, a 
	<a href="memoryWall.html">memory wall</a> was set up for attendees to record
	their thoughts.</p>
	</div>
<p>This year is the 25th year of the all-LARP convention we've come to know as
Intercon. While it's nearly impossible to give proper credit to the hundreds of
people that have contributed to the convention and the art and practice of
Live-Action Role Playing, we can take a moment and look at a partial history of
Intercon conventions.</p>
<p>In 1982, the Harvard Society for Interactive Literature, later just SIL, was
formed. This group, along with the MIT Assassins Guild, was one of the original
groups doing theatre-style LARP. In 1986, they held their first convention,
SiLicon I, and would soon produce a magazine, Metagame, the first LARP magazine
anywhere. SiLicon would move from the Boston area down the east coast to the
Baltimore area with the intention of finding a stable venue.</p>
<p>However, organizational issues resulted in the fracturing of SIL and the
creation of the Interactive Literature Foundation (ILF) that would continue to
produce all-LARP conventions, the next one being in New Jersey. However,
logistical difficulties kept most of the next several conventions in the early
'90s close to or in Maryland.</p>
<p>At that time, the conventions consisted almost entirely of full-weekend
LARPs, that being the state of the art at the time. In 1992, Intercon 7.5 was
the first convention with all shorter-form LARPs, which proved to be popular.
Intercon 9.5, in 1994, was basically indistinguishable from Intercon conventions
today. Intercon conventions in the late 90s soon provided a stable set of
short-form LARPs and the opportunities for community and networking that a
convention provides. Meanwhile, full-length theatre-style LARPs continued in
other venues. Both would fight the rise of vampire LARP, which also happened at
this time, threatening to eclipse everything else.</p>
<p>In 1998, an Intercon convention, Intercon the Thirteenth, returned to the
Boston area, thanks to the efforts of a lot of people, many of whom are still
involved with the convention today. This turned out to be a wise move as
full-length LARP was becoming less popular, while a number of strong campaign
LARPs had swept the Baltimore area, reducing the player base for an Intercon
convention there. On the other hand, the Boston area had a strong player base
that was largely free of other, longer-form opportunities.</p>
<p>While the Boston-area convention was being established, logistical and
financial difficulties in 2000, including the collapse of Metagame magazine, led
to the establishment of the Live Action Roleplayers Association (LARPA) which
would license the Intercon name for all-LARP conventions, allowing local
organizations to produce them. This would lead to another period of growth with
two conventions: one in the Boston area and one in the Baltimore area, with the
"annual" convention to be switched between them.</p>
<p>That success led to even more success and an Intercon convention was licensed
in New Jersey, thanks to the efforts of two different local groups. For various
reasons the New Jersey conventions ended quietly and, more recently, the
Baltimore area convention is on hiatus.</p>
<p>Today, there are other all-LARP conventions around the world, some inspired
by Intercon conventions, others developed independently. But the Intercon
convention can look at a 25 year history of adaption and innovation in making
the all-LARP convention possible and popular. With the Boston convention still
thriving and, with the move to a larger venue, hopefully Intercon conventions
will continue for another 25 years!</p>
<!--
  I've radically simplified and cleaned up this table, so that it's easier to 
  look at here. I've gotten rid of all the funky characters. That eliminated the
  funky key at the bottom as well. Sure, it's not quite the same as the original
  version, but I think we can live with that.
  
  All of the formatting and layout is now driven by CSS.
