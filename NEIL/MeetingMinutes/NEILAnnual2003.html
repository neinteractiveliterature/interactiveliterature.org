<h3>Minutes of the NEIL Annual Meeting for 2003</h3>
<p>The NEIL Board held its annual meeting on February 27th, 2003, at Jeff
Diewald's house, in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, after the Intercon C Packet
packing party. In attendance:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Chad Bergeron</li>
	<li>Dave Clarkson</li>
	<li>Jeff Diewald</li>
	<li>Michael McAfee (president)</li>
	<li>Charles Sumner (non-voting advisor)</li>
	<li>Tim Lasko (non-voting observer)</li>
</ul>
<p>With the Board's approval, Charles Sumner contacted Mark Waks by telephone to
obtain his proxy for the Board Meeting.</p>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Upcoming Election</h3>
<p>There was a discussion of the bylaws for electing new Board members. Several issues were raised that merit discussion at a future meeting:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Board turnover is 60% every year.</p></li>
	<li><p>The Con Chair for next con needs to prepare early, before the current
	con. This raises questions over voting power and when the next Chair should
	get it.</p></li>
	<li><p>Those who are on the board don't get a vote if they are running for
	reelection. This raises a problem. Suppose that A and B are on the Board
	with terms expiring, and C is the outgoing chair. If A and C are running for
	board slots, that means there's only three people on the board who can
	vote.</p></li>
	<li><p>Expanding the Board to seven was discussed. It was concluded that
	this didn't solve the problems, and could make them worse.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Given these issues and the con-chair election concerns raised earlier in the
year by the convention committee, it suggests that NEIL should reconsider how
these elections are held in the future.</p>
<p>Acknowledging these concerns, a motion was made to clarify and publish the
process for the upcoming NEIL election, as defined in the current by-laws.
Additionally, another call for volunteers would be made, with nominations to
close after Saturday, March 1st, 2003. The vote was unanimous to support this
motion.</p>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Website</h3>
<p>There was a discussion of the pros and cons of the Intercon C website and the candidate Intercon D website.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The con website is the throughput for con and NEIL finances.</p></li>
	<li><p>The con website is NEIL's face on the web.</p></li>
	<li><p>NEIL itself has a much simpler web requirement.</p></li>  
	<li><p>It is clear that the con must have a website that meets the con's
	needs. As with everything related to the con, it is a good practice to
	review the requirements and suitability of the website every year.</p></li>
	<li><p>The most successful conventions are those that have gotten an early
	start, with materials available at the time of the previous convention. This
	requires advance efforts, without interfering in the organizational efforts
	for the current con.</p></li>
	<li><p>The con chair is responsible for determining the needs of the
	convention, which includes the website. The NEIL board is responsible for
	electing a con-chair with the capacity and responsibility for making these
	determinations for the con. The consensus is that the NEIL board should
	defer most decisions to the con chair, to support them in their crucial and
	significant position.</p></li>
	<li><p>The candidate website requires us to find a hosting solution. This
	will probably cost NEIL between $150 and $200 each year. The Treasurer
	reported that every convention except Intercon B made enough to meet this
	need. There are also sufficient funds in the NEIL bank account to cover
	costs for this year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A motion was made to switch to the new website. The motion was seconded. The
vote was unanimous in favor of switching to the new website.</p>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Registration and advance payment</h3>
<p>There was a discussion of the number of registrants for Intercon C that are
signed up for games but who have not yet paid for their membership. The
Treasurer reported that this was a serious budget concern. These people do not
have a financial investment in the convention. Should there be a large number of
"no shows", it could hurt convention receipts and cause difficulties for some
games. It was suggested that requiring attendees to pay for their registration
before allowing game signups would help the convention fiscally and make players
more likely to show up.</p>
<p>A motion was made to require payment for registration before game signup is
allowed for Intercon D and future conventions. The vote was unanimous in favor
of the motion.</p>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Communications</h3>
<p>The Board composed an email message clarifying the election process and
repeating the call for volunteers. This message was sent to the convention
committee at the Board meeting.</p>
<p>The Board composed an email message stating its position on the website
change. This message was sent to the convention committee at the Board
meeting.</p>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Suspension of meeting</h3>
<p>The Board agreed to suspend the annual meeting until the nominations for the
upcoming elections were available at Intercon C, on March 2nd, 2003.</p>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Resumption of meeting</h3>
<p>The NEIL board resumed its annual meeting at 11:00am on March 2nd, 2003, at
Intercon C in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. In attendance:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Chad Bergeron</li>
	<li>Dave Clarkson</li>
	<li>Jeff Diewald</li>
	<li>Tim Lasko (incoming president)</li>
	<li>Michael McAfee (outgoing president)</li>
	<li>Mark Waks</li>
</ul>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Hotel Contract for Intercon D</h3>
<p>Dave Clarkson reported that the hotel contract for Intercon D in 2004 was in
hand. The deadline for signing is April 16. A notable change is that the cost of
the facility space is going up by $100. Dave reported that the hotel management
suggested some alternative financial options to help mitigate the cost of
convention function space.</p>
<p>The board agreed to defer any action on the suggestions until the Treasurer
has closed the books on Intercon C to determine how well the Board did under the
current arrangements. This is expected to be completed in the next two weeks. A
virtual (email) meeting will be held to discuss any possible changes at that
time.</p>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>NEIL Board elections</h3>
<p>As of 12:01am on March 2nd, the following people had nominated themselves for
the two open seats on the NEIL board: Jeff Diewald, Cheryl Knoepler, Alex
Newman, Charles Sumner, Ilene Tatroe, Mike Tatroe, Will Wagner and Christina
White. Mike Caprio had asked that his name be removed from consideration.</p>
<p>Jeff Diewald, running for re-election, recused himself from discussion and
left the meeting.</p>
<p>The board shared their discussions and experiences with each candidate,
according to the by-laws, and elected Jeff Diewald and Cheryl Knoepler to fill
the two open seats.</p>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
