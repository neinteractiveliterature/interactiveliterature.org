		receipt of an undertaking by such individual to repay the amounts so
		paid to the Corporation if he shall be adjudicated to be not entitled to
		indemnification under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 180, Section
		6, which undertaking may be accepted without reference to the financial
		ability of such persons to make repayment. The right of indemnification

		Corporation, and</p>

		Code.</p>
