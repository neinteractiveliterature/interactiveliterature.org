<h3>What is NELCO 2016?</h3>
<p>The New England Larp Conference is a multi-tradition event focused on the
craft of LARP. It will be a weekend of LARP discussions, panels, workshops, and
build-your-own-games. As opposed to a gaming convention, the Conference will not
be a weekend of playing and running games, but will instead be discussion and
workshop based. If you've attended the Intercon Pre-con, that is the inspiration
for this event.</p>
<p>This year, Stephen Kohler is the NELCO Coordinator.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>The conference will happen at the Holiday Inn in Boxborough MA. We have
arranged a number of rooms in a block with the rate of $109 for single and
double occupancy, $119 for triple, and $129 for quad. Staying at the hotel is
not required to attend, and panels and workshops will run until around 11 at
night, while the Build Your Own Game will run overnight.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Build Your Own Game Workshop</h3>
<p>Over the course of the weekend, starting Friday night, we'll be running a
Build Your Own Game workshop. Whether you've never written a game, or are an
experienced author, it's a great time, and a great way to learn new techniques.
If you have any questions about this project, just drop us a line at 
<i>nelco AT interactiveliterature DOT org</i>.</p>
<p>The game will run on Sunday, so we're looking for people interested in
writing a new LARP as a team. If we have enough people interested, we'll split
into multiple teams, so please let us know ahead of time by signing up for the
"Build Your Own Game Author" flavor of attendee and filling out the survey. More
details can be found <a href="buildYourOwnGame2016.html">in this 
document</a>.</p>

<h3>Food</h3>
<p>The hotel has a restaurant, and typically attendees go en-masse to meals to
continue discussions started in panels and swap LARP stories.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Conference Rules</h3>
<p>For the most part we're a low-key conference, so there's not a lot here.
Mostly it boils down to "Don't be a dick". We do believe that all public events
should have an explicit harassment policy so:</p>
<p><b>Harassment Policy</b></p>
<p>NELCO and NEIL are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age,
religion, or any other factor. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
attendees in any form. Conference attendees violating these rules may be
sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of
the conference organizers.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
have any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference Senior Staff
immediately.</p>
