<h3>7:00 PM <i>New World Magischola</i> Meet-Up (social hang out)</h3>
<p>A space for those who participated in any of the New World Magischola runs to
meet people from other weekends and reminisce about their time in wizarding
college. People who weren’t involved but want to ask about how it was in a
casual atmosphere also welcome!</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>8:00 PM: LARP Writing 101</h3>
<p>Presentation by Jeff Diewald</p>
<p>Over the course of the weekend, starting Friday night, we'll be running a
Build Your Own Game workshop. Whether you've never written a game, or are an
experienced author, it's a great time, and a great way to learn new techniques.
The LARP Writing 101 session will lay out the basics how to construct a LARP,
and start the process of imagining what kind of game will be written this
weekend.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.vortexofchaos.net/larpTheoryAndPractice.html">slides
and a video of the presentation</a> are available online.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="NelcoDayTitle">Saturday</h2>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>10:00 AM - Mix it Up: Using The Mixing Desk of LARP to Build and Design 
LARPs (Talk)</h3>
<p>The Mixing Desk of Larp is a tool for teaching larp design. Just like the
sound technician can adjust the faders of a mixing desk to increase or decrease
the volume of different instruments, the larp designer adjusts the faders of the
Mixing Desk of Larp through their design choices, adding or removing faders to
create the unique and smoothly operating larps. The Mixing Desk of Larp is the
method that has been successfully used to educate larpwriters for 5 years now,
which resulted in designing over 40 playable larps run throughout the world. We
believe this gives designers a better way of structuring their thoughts,
applying larp theory in practice and communicating design choices.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>10:00 AM - Start in the Middle, End Before Consequences: Anime as a Model
for 4 hour Theater Style LARP (Roundtable)</h3>
<p>LARP tends to take its inspiration from many different sources, including
film and novel. One area that is growing in popularity is that of anime. What
narrative tricks and techniques can we learn from this new(er) area of study?
What has already been done, and what can we do in the future? Come discuss these
topics in a Roundtable discussion.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>11:00 AM - Writing and Running Comedic Games (Talk)</h3>
<p>Comedy is already a challenging genre to work in, even before adding the
extra challenge involved in LARP writing. It’s one thing to write comedic
character sheets, but another entirely in shaping a game world, mechanics, and
structure to encourage comedic events and actions within the LARP itself. How
can we write LARPs structured to encourage comedic play without removing player
agency? Can we make all our players into comedians without years of practice?
Come listen to our speakers discuss the techniques and tricks they’ve used to
put the laughter into LARP.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>11:00 AM - Information Flow in Boffer LARPs (Moderated Panel)</h3>
<p>In Accelerant games, it's become sadly common for someone to stand up and
shout "OK EVERYONE LISTEN UP" and then explain what the goal is and a sort of
in-game explanation of what the mechanics will be. It's all very loud and
chaotic, and there are still issues with players not hearing. Then during
battle, it's extremely common for most people to not know how far along we are
towards our goal or if new stuff has popped up, etc. Accelerant has some
mechanics that help convey information, but how can we do it better?</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>12:30 PM - Exploring Difficult Topics Safely Through LARP (Workshop)</h3>
<p>Many LARPs delve into strong emotional areas; they can induce strong
emotions, cause bleed, or cause the players to explore some very difficult
topics. How can a GM ensure that their players are emotionally safe both during
and after such games? We’ll explore several emotional safety techniques in this
workshop, including practicing them in an interactive environment.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>12:30 PM - Beyond the Con: Booking LARPs Outside of Conventions (Talk)</h3>
<p>One often-overlooked problem with running a LARP is getting space to actually
run the event in. While conventions like Intercon exist to facilitate running
LARPs, sometimes you might want to run a LARP in a new area, or run a larger
LARP than a convention can support, or maybe you want to run a LARP that just
doesn’t work in hotel-style space. No matter what the reason, the logistics of
booking a space can be a real hassle; fortunately, our speakers have jumped that
hurdle before. Come listen to experienced LARP-runners talk about dealing with
hotels, campgrounds, and wherever else you might want to run a LARP.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>1:45 PM - How Class Affects LARP (Moderated Roundtable)</h3>
<p>One aspect of LARP that isn’t examined as much as perhaps it could be is that
of the financial costs associated with it. Specifically, the demographics of
LARPers tend to skew towards those who have the disposable income to afford to
put together elaborate costumes, or travel to participate in remote LARP events.
How do these facts affect LARP as a whole? Come discuss this topic in our
moderated roundtable discussion.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>1:45 PM - MEDIC! : Healers in LARP and Other RP Media (Moderated Panel)</h3>
<p>Healers in LARP (and other RPGs, such as tabletops and videogames) often get
treated like Hit Point batteries, or as though they exist simply to back up the
front line fighters, who are often seen as the stars of the show. We often have
disparaging terms like "backpack healer" and "girlfriend healer". How do we make
sure healers feel like the stars sometimes too? How do we show appreciation for
them, make sure they have equal access to loot, etc.? What are good mechanics
for healers? Why don't we ever pay them? Let's show some Healer Love!</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>3:00 PM - So You Want to Box a LARP (Talk)</h3>
<p>As theatrical-style LARP grows in popularity and gains a history of popular
LARPs, the re-running of old LARPs, and the running of LARPs by people other
than the original authors has likewise grown in popularity. This has led to the
development of the “boxing” of LARPs, where, theoretically, one “box” (likely a
zipped file of some kind) contains all the information you need in order to run
a LARP; just add paper! In practice, this is easier said than done. Come listen
to one GM’s experiences with running other people’s LARPs, and the things he
believes are necessary to make your boxed LARP one to be remembered and used for
years to come.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>3:00 PM - Skip to the Good Part: Structuring LARPs to Eliminate Downtime 
(Moderated Panel)</h3>
<p>How many LARPs have you played where the first few minutes are a confusing
jumble following “Game Start”, where people are awkwardly huddled around
wherever they happened to be sitting for game briefing? How do you start a game
“in media res”, instead of wherever you happen to be? Can you run a “doing the
plan” scene in a LARP without doing all the tedious planning? What methods exist
to build your LARP’s pacing and structure? Come listen to our panel of LARP
writers and players talk about favorite techniques and tricks to make your LARP
stand out from the crowd.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>4:15 PM - <i>We are Citizens</i>: A Review and Retrospective (Talk)</h3>
<p><i>We are Citizens</i> (WAC) is a two-day larp about homeless people in the city of
Minsk. During the larp, players live the lives of homeless people on the street.
A unique aspect of the larp is that the players get a new 360-degree experience
in their familiar city surroundings. The larp was first run in September 2015 in
Minsk, Belarus for 10 players. The presenter, who is one of the authors, will
talk about their design choices, player experiences, and their larger goals. In
addition, there will demonstrations of some of the workshops used in the WAC
larp. To get an idea of what the LARP is, you can watch its presentation on
YouTube 
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jL4JQVJbs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jL4JQVJbs</a>) 
or its coverage in the local Belarusian media (in Belarusian here:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXfWsy98TkE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXfWsy98TkE</a>)</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>4:15 PM - Accelerant Theory and Practice (Moderated Panel)</h3>
<p>Boffer combats come in many shapes and sizes. How do the rules of combat
affect the experience of your players? Can these rules be designed to address
issues common to boffer play, such as clumping, or neglected healers? What
effect do the special rules of NPCs have on the flow of combat, and the
resultant narrative? This panel will explore all of these topics, and how the
Accelerant system addresses them.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>5:30 PM - Using Online RP to Enhance LARP (Moderated Roundtable)</h3>
<p>In the modern world, roleplaying doesn’t always take place in person. In
fact, many LARPs use one form or another of online roleplaying to supplement
their in-person events. From character building and development pre-game to
in-between event forums and discussions, online RP is becoming more and more
common. Does this all benefit our LARPing experiences? Can we use online
roleplaying as an effective tool, while avoiding the pitfalls they pose? Come
discuss this topic with our moderator.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>5:30 PM - The Right Kind of Writing; Comparing and Contrasting LARP-Writing 
Tools (Moderated Panel)</h3>
<p>There are a <i>lot</i> of tools out there to write a LARP with. Some of those
tools are written by LARPers, with LARPers in mind. Others are written for more
general application, such as novel or playwriting, or coding. Are either of
these tool sets superior? How do the tools we use influence the LARP we produce?
Come listen to our panel of experts discuss their favorite LARP-writing tools,
and the benefits and disadvantages each one poses.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>8:30 PM - <i>New World Magischola</i>: An Event to Remember (Panel)</h3>
<p><i>New World Magischola</i> was an experiment by two American GMs to bring
the magic (literally and figuratively) of a <i>College of Wizardry</i>-style
event across the pond to America. With a hugely successful kickstarter, a large
player base, unique location, and four runs within two months, <i>NWM</i> has
become something unique in American Nordic-style LARPing history. Come listen to
our panel of <i>NWM</i> players discuss their experiences in <i>NWM</i>; what
they enjoyed, what wasn’t as great, and the experiences that will remain with
them for years and years to come.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>8:30 PM - Designing Interesting Hooks for Boffer Modules (Moderated Panel)</h3>
<p>How do you make an interesting module hook? How do you prep the NPC so they
know what to say? What's the best way to pre-hook? (And is there such thing as a
post-hook?) How do we get information flowing without resorting to someone
standing on a chair and shouting "HEY LISTEN UP" like a camp counselor shouting
at campers? How can we everyone who wants to be involved gets hooked? Why are
all hooks spread by people, and not things like letters?</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>9:45 PM - Death and Abuse: What <i>Game of Thrones</i> Means for LARP 
Writers (Moderated Roundtable)</h3>
<p><i>Game of Thrones</i> is one of the most popular cable television shows
ever, with a cultural following unimaginable even a few year ago. Clearly,
<i>something</i> has shifted in terms of what people want to watch for
entertainment. But what? Are people just drawn to the graphic nature of the
show, or are they growing more accepting of death and perhaps more willing to
discuss sensitive topics such as abuse? Come discuss this topic in a roundtable
environment, where we will delve into the whys and wherefores of Westeros.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>9:45 PM - I&auml; I&auml;; Rituals in LARP (Moderated Panel)</h3>
<p>Lots of LARPs feature rituals, often in fantasy settings as a means of
producing magic. How does one craft a ritual that is fun, meaningful, engaging,
and respectful of real world rituals? How can we use them to encourage roleplay?
How can we make rituals fun and immersive? Come listen to our panelists as they
discuss these questions.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="NelcoDayTitle">Sunday</h2>

<h3>12:00 PM: LARP - Play in the BYOG</h3>
<p>They have worked all weekend to produce a LARP, and this is it. Sign up to
play the BYOG! Please arrive a little early so we can start on time.</p>
