<h3>8 PM: LARP Writing 101</h3>
<p>Run by: Jeff Diewald</p>
<p>Over the course of the weekend, starting Friday night, we'll be running a
Build Your Own Game workshop. Whether you've never written a game, or are an
experienced author, it's a great time, and a great way to learn new techniques.
The LARP Writing 101 session will lay out the basics how to construct a LARP,
and start the process of imagining what kind of game will be written this
weekend.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>8 PM: Latex LARP Weapons Making (Workshop)</h3>
<p>Run by: Erik Trinkl</p>
<p>With the assistance of the owners of Monster Camp, LLC, Maurice Spaulding and
Josh Slowick, we will show how to construct safe latex LARP weapons. We will
provide materials to those interested to get their hands dirty.</p>
<p>Unlike common belief, the purpose is also to show that these weapons are safe
and can be built cheaply at home. Latex or latex-like foam weapons are becoming
more and more popular in the United States. In most European countries like
Germany, latex weapons are the only permitted weapons, because they look
realistic and allow a much more immersive environment. Hopefully, you find
enjoyment learning to build a latex weapon of your own during this period.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>8 PM: Clearing Your Waitlist: Adding characters to an existing game</h3>
<p>Run by: Lise Fracalossi</p>
<p>So you have bid a game to intercon and now you have 5 awesome players on your
waitlist. Time to clear your waitlist. We will discuss the challenges of adding
characters to an existing game – not just "intercon" games but also campaign
games.</p>
<p>Panelists: Lise has been larping for ten years and is the author of two
larps: <i>League of Extraordinary Hogwarts Students</i> and <i>Cracks in the
Orb</i>. She's also been known to opine on historical costuming.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>9:30 PM: When Theater &amp; Boffer Collide</h3>
<p>Run by: Adina Schreiber</p>
<p>Boffer games have traditionally been build-your-own character campaign games.
Theater games have been traditionally pre-generated character one-shots. Over
the last few years we have had several successful boffer one-shots at intercon,
as evidenced by increasing numbers of players crossing over. What has made those
recent intercon games successful? What kind of changes need to be made for
having theater-style LARPers in a boffer campaign? How can we get the best of
both worlds?</p>
<p>Adina enjoys both boffer and theater LARPing, serves as Intercon’s
raffle coordinator, is currently serving on the NEIL board, is a member of Bid
Com, and needs more cowbell.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>10:45 PM: BYOG Brainstorming</h3>
<p>The BYOG team start the writing process in earnest. People who aren't going
to be working on the BYOG are encouraged to come and to bring their ideas for
potential games they'd like to see written.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="NelcoDayTitle">Saturday</h2>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>11 AM: What Live Action Roleplaying Games do well</h3>
<p>Presentation by Ken Clary</p>
<p>A talk which offers up ways that LRPGs are and are not like other mediums,
what uniquely defines what they do well, and advice for letting what they do
well flourish. Learn why the G is important in LRPG, the strengths of emergent
gameplay in larps, and how not to stifle either.</p>
<p>Ken Clary began larping in 1996, and writing larps in earnest in 1997. He's
been an author of 24 (and counting) games --- mostly for the MIT Assassins'
Guild --- and has run somewhere around 50 events. He is the developer and
maintainer of GameTeX, a game production system, has run Guild Camp (a 2-week
gamewriting boot camp) for the past 9 summers, and semi-regularly organizes "The
Ides of March," a short game-design panel. He has been a playtester (and once,
the lead playtester) for a small number of GURPS publications (by Steve Jackson
Games). He has also been boffer-larping since 2000, and is the Staff Director
for Witchwood, an ongoing fantasy boffer game that currently runs in Ashby,
Mass.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>11 AM:  LARP: Betrothals &amp; Betrayals (Play or Run)</h3>
<p>Play in, or help run, a short LARP with an eye towards having all the players
and GMs sit down and deconstruct how the game went, where in the writing or
design the best scenes came from, etc. We have time for two runs, and the
discussion on the game will be after the second run. The total page count of the
game is low, so we should be able to consider all the written material in our
discussion.</p>
<p>LARP Description: Lady Bathurst has invited a number of eligible young ladies
and gentleman to stay at Albion Hall, in the hope of finding a suitable match
for her only daughter. However, behind the polite conversation and pleasant
surroundings lurks many a dark secret and hidden agenda...</p>
<p>Inspired by the works of Jane Austen and Susanna Clark, this LARP was written
by Donna Giltrap and Debbie Cowens.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>11 AM: Latex LARP Weapons Making (Workshop)</h3>

<p>With the assistance of the owners of Monster Camp, LLC, Maurice Spaulding and

enjoyment learning to build a latex weapon of your own during this period.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>12:30 PM: Describing Game Mechanics (Panel)</h3>
<p>How do we describe the mechanics we use? Would you want to know what kind of
mechanics a game uses before we sign up? What does it mean to be mechanics light
or heavy? This will be a discussion that leads into a Focus Group to provide
NEIL with a recommendation on how to categorize games.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>12:30 PM: Ars Amandi Workshop</h3>
<p>Run by: Marsha Gershorn</p>
<p>"LARPs need love. Think about it: in a typical LARP, your character is far
more likely to kill something or die than she is to fall in love. The ability to
play romance and love safely would open up a whole new vista of possible plots
and character developments." - Lizzie Stark</p>
<p>Ars Amandi is a Nordic LARP mechanic for playing out intimate physical
encounters in game, simulating romance or sex by mutual touching of safe
permitted upper-body zones. It is an immersive way for players to more deeply
explore the emotions of their own characters, and to more meaningfully connect
with other characters in a way that may otherwise be difficult to tap into
during a LARP. This is a very useful and versatile mechanic to have in your
toolkit as players, and to incorporate into your own LARPs as writers.</p>
<p>In this guided group workshop, we will be using only hands and forearms as
permitted zones to safely ease into practicing this mechanic with one another.
Please plan to arrive on-time as we will be closing the door to maintain
privacy.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>2 PM: Eliminating Downtime</h3>
<p>Often, games have periods of downtime, because they’re plot-light, NPC-light,
by design, or various other reasons. Join us for a round-table discussion of
what causes downtime, and how to avoid it in your games whether they be
theatre-style or boffer.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>2 PM: Describing Game Mechanics (Focus Group)</h3>
<p>A Focus Group / Working group will have an in depth discussion resulting in a
recommendation to NEIL on how to categorize game mechanics for intercon. All are
welcome to join.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>2 PM: LARP: Betrothals &amp; Betrayals (Play or Run)</h3>
<p>Play in, or help run, a short LARP with an eye towards having all the players
and GMs sit down and deconstruct how the game went, where in the writing or
design the best scenes came from, etc. We have time for two runs, and the
discussion on the game will be after the second run. The total page count of the

<!------------------------------------->
<h3>3:30 PM: Stuffing: Making Sure the Game you Wrote is the Game they Get</h3>
<p>Presentation by Stephen Kohler</p>
<p>Very often, in discussions of writing games, running games, and playing
games, the act of stuffing a game is barely mentioned. If it comes up at all,
it's only to mention "oh, and don't mess up stuffing" or some other useless
platitude. But the act of stuffing a game can be hugely important, and can make
the difference between a good run and a bad run of a game. In this talk, I'll go
over techniques that I've developed from 7 years of running games at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute; what works, what doesn't, what will make your life
better, and what will make it worse. I will also give advice on how to prepare
for stuffing in the writing stages so that when it comes time to prep, you're
not left in the lurch. Remember, good stuffing might not fix a bad game, but bad
stuffing can ruin a good one!</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>5 PM: GM Services (Panel)</h3>
<p>Traditionally, the GMs do everything needed to make a game happen (except
costuming which is traditionally delegated to players). At intercon and other
mini-LARP weekends, two tasks are handled “horizontally” by the event organizers
(space booking, and player sign-up). Are there other things that might be turned
into services? A pool of run-time GMs; Set-making services; centralized casting;
an NPC pool; Printing &amp; Typesetting; Game Photos; LARP boxing services?</p>
<p>This will be a discussion that leads into a Focus Group to provide NEIL with
a framework for possible future services.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>8 PM: Designing for Repeat Players</h3>
<p>Have you ever played a LARP twice? Have you had players who played your game
multiple times? What was your experience? Should we be shifting our culture
towards designing games for re-playability? Is that even possible? What are some
of the issues involved with this? Are we doing anything right now that makes
re-playing a game harder?</p>
<p>Mark (Justin du Coeur) Waks has long been sought by authorities on suspicion
of committing Strange Acts of Interactive Literature. It is believed that he is
currently organizing a new underground network known only as "Querki", making it
easier for impressionable youths to partake in the insidious artform known as
"LARP writing". If spotted, do not attempt capture, but please contact the
appropriate authorities immediately.</p>
<p>Cameron Betts - always exploring the variety of experiences LARPs have to
offer, Cameron is starting a video blog called <i>LARP Out of Character</i>,
featuring interviews with LARPers about what motivates them, and how they think
about LARP.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>8 PM: LARP Deconstruction</h3>
<p>All the players and GMs from <i>Betrothals &amp; Betrayals</i> sit down and
deconstruct how the game went, where in the writing or design the best scenes
came from, etc. The total page count of the game is low, so we should be able to
consider all the written material in our discussion.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>8 PM: GM Services (Focus Group)</h3>
<p>A Focus Group / Working group will have an in depth discussion resulting in a
framework for possible services to send as a recommendation to NEIL. All are
welcome to join.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>9:30 PM: Introduction to Foreign LARP</h3>
<p>Presentation by Erik Trinkl</p>
<p>In this class, I wish to introduce some general aspects of foreign LARPs,
particularly medieval fantasy LARP. There are many stereotypes, myths and
misconceptions about foreign LARPs, for example the term "European-style" . The
internet permits anybody to access and view pictures and videos on foreign
LARPs. However, much of the media about LARP on the internet is in different
languages and American LARPers cannot associate themselves with what is
presented without previous experience.</p>
<p>While I grew up in Germany, I was a vivid LARPer there. I maintained several
important connections in the German LARP scene which include the largest LARP
magazine, LARP-Zeit, the German Liveroleplaying Association and other
organization. I have visited mega-events in the past; Bicolline (Canada),
Drachenfest and Newe Order - prequel to Conquest of Mythodea (Germany). So far,
I have been reporting and writing articles primarily for LARP-Zeit.</p>
<p>This presentation is intended to give a closer insight on foreign LARPs. Of
course, North-American LARP is different to foreign LARPs, but not many people
have experienced foreign LARPs. In this course I will utilize illustrations,
statistics and other materials to show the current developments of LARP
primarily in Germany.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>11 PM: LARP Party</h3>
<p>Party Time! NELCO will be hosting a party in the conference space well into 
the night.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="NelcoDayTitle">Sunday</h2>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>10 AM: LARP Brunch</h3>
<p>Join us for breakfast at Moonstones nearby for a free-form larp-discussion
brunch with delicious food. A signup sheet will be available friday and
saturday, or contact Dave Kapell if you’re interested.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>12:30 PM: What will LARP look like in 15 years</h3>
<p>15 years ago theater LARPs were dominated by weekend-long one shot games and
build-your-own-character campaign games, and NERO dominated boffer games. What
are the long-term trends in LARP plotting, writing and structure? How could
technology impact LARP? Let’s peer into our crystal ball, and see what LARP will
look like in 15 years.</p>
<p>Mark (Justin du Coeur) Waks has long been sought by authorities on suspicion
of committing Strange Acts of Interactive Literature. It is believed that he is
currently organizing a new underground network known only as "Querki", making it
easier for impressionable youths to partake in the insidious artform known as
"LARP writing". If spotted, do not attempt capture, but please contact the
appropriate authorities immediately.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>12:30 PM: Describing Game Mechanics (Focus Group Report)</h3>
<p>Those who participated in the Describing Game Mechanics focus group will 
share the results of their labor.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>12:30 PM: LARP - Play in the BYOG</h3>
<p>They have worked all weekend to produce a LARP, and this is it. Sign up to
play the BYOG! Please arrive a little early so we can start on time.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>2 PM: 5 Plots every game should have</h3>
<p>The panelists have each come up with the 5 most powerful flexible LARP plots.
Crowd pleasers, and stand-by staples. Bring a few of your own!</p>
