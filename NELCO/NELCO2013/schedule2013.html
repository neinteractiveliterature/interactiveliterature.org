<h3>Ars Amandi Workshop</h3>
<h5>Marsha Gershon</h5>
<p>"LARPs need love. Think about it: in a typical LARP, your character is far
more likely to kill something or die than she is to fall in love. The ability to
play romance and love safely would open up a whole new vista of possible plots
and character developments." - Lizzie Stark</p>
<p>Ars Amandi is a Nordic LARP mechanic for playing out intimate physical
encounters in game, simulating romance or sex by mutual touching of safe
permitted upper-body zones. It is an immersive way for players to more deeply
explore the emotions of their own characters, and to more meaningfully connect
with other characters in a way that may otherwise be difficult to tap into
during a LARP. This is a very useful and versatile mechanic to have in your
toolkit as players, and to incorporate into your own LARPs as writers.</p>
<p>In this guided group workshop, we will be using only hands and forearms as
permitted zones to safely ease into practicing this mechanic with one another.
Please plan to arrive on-time as we will be closing the door to maintain
privacy.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Blogging Larp</h3>
<h5>Kevin Riggle, Sparrow Rubin, Adina Schreiber</h5>
<p>It's not well-organized, but there's a surprising amount of larp blogging on
the Internet. (If finding anything on the Internet and in quantity can be
surprising, cf. Rule 34.) And there are almost as many reasons people blog about
larp as there are larp bloggers. So why blog about larp? Who else does so? What
unique challenges do larp bloggers face? Where is larp blogging going -- or
where should it go? And how does one get started?</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Bring-your-own-non-physical mechanics workshop</h3>
<h5>Peter Litwack</h5>
<p>Have a mechanic that just won't work right? Not sure how to balance your
numbers? Can't seem to finish that mechanic? Bring it in to workshop your
mechanic with an experienced mechanic designer!</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>BYOG Brainstorming Session</h3>
<h5>Jeff Diewald</h5>
<p>This is where the Build Your Own Game seminar participants pitch their ideas
for the BYOG LARP. Bring your concepts, your character ideas, the styles of
games you'd like to write, and what you really think should be in a LARP.
Nothing is off the table - all ideas will be considered and discussed. Jeff will
facilitate the discussion as we figure out what excites the team, and what is
doable within the time span. The choice of what we write is decided by consensus
- we pick something that everyone wants to work on.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in participating, please fill out the survey at: 
<a href="https://secure.journeysurveys.com/answer/prompt/402">https://secure.journeysurveys.com/answer/prompt/402</a></p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>BYOG Writing</h3>
<h5>Jeff Diewald</h5>
<p>There will be players waiting to playtest a LARP on Sunday. This is where the
design and the writing gets done. There's no better way to learn about LARP
design and solving LARP problems than by actually writing one - and this is the
place to be.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in participating, please fill out the survey at: 
<a href="https://secure.journeysurveys.com/answer/prompt/402">https://secure.journeysurveys.com/answer/prompt/402</a></p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>BYOG Run (larp)</h3>
<h5>Jeff Diewald</h5>
<p>An enthusiastic creative team has just spent an entire day writing a brand
new LARP. They need enthusiastic LARPers to take it out for a playtest. The
details about the LARP and a signup sheet will be posted outside the board room
sometime around dinner time on Saturday.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Cavalier Era Fashion for the Well-Attired Larper</h3>
<h5>Lise Fracalossi</h5>
<p>The Cavalier Era, roughly defined as "early 17th century" is a fascinating
transitional period of fashion, featuring a style more relaxed than late Tudor
and less intricate than Rococco. More importantly to a LARPer, it's the setting
for several larps, including the weekend-long <i>King's Musketeers</i>, which is
making a return to the DC era next fall.</p>
<p>This is an educational presentation aimed at all levels of costuming skill.
Come and learn how to recognize men's and women's Cavalier-era fashions in order
to assemble your own!</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Hour of the Rant</h3>
<h5>Chris Amherst</h5>
<p>Are you tired of hearing about bleed? Does it piss you off when your latest
combat mechanic is discussed and someone says "Oh, we did that back in 
1997"?</p>
<p>Do you just wish people would go back to the good ol' LARP days of staking
vampires, slaughtering dark elves, and shooting zombies?</p>
<p>Inspired by the Knutepunkt tradition and the "Players are Scum" / "GMs are
Bastards" discussions by Tony and Sue - we present an hour filled with epic and
uncensored rants (all under 5 minutes) on topics of utmost importance (at least
according to the speaker).</p>
<p>WARNING: Panel may contain humor, profanity, adult situations, and the
possibility of controversy.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Information Economy Design</h3>
<h5>Chad Bergeron, Peter Litwack, Mark Waks</h5>
<p>Information: the who, what, where, when, how, and why that keeps larpers
engaged with the plot and with the game. Too little information and players are
frustrated or angry. Too much information and players are unable to sort the
important from the unimportant or to focus. Information is a universal
bargaining currency. It's a critical plot device. How do you seed the
information in your game so the key parts get to the key characters? Too quickly
and the game sputters out early. Too slowly and the game ends while players are
still trying to piece it all together. Come talk about the different ways to get
the information in to your game, and how to adjust the spigot.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>LARP Writing 101</h3>
<h5>Jeff Diewald</h5>
<p>Jeff Diewald presents a seminar on LARP theory. So you want to write a LARP,
and you're here for the Build Your Own Game effort. Maybe you're just interested
in what goes into creating a LARP, even if you're not going to write. (Oh,
c'mon. Give the writing a try!) Jeff Diewald has written or cowritten more than
a dozen LARPs in many different formats and genres. He's given previous versions
of this presentation to other BYOG LARP writing efforts. Come listen to the
interesting concepts and ideas that go into his LARP writing process, to give
you ideas on how you can improve (or start) your own creative efforts.</p>
<p>You should attend this if you're going to take part in the Build Your Own
Game effort. You're quite welcome to attend if you're not going to take part in
the BYOG. (More details about the Build Your Own Game workshop is under the
<a href="buildYourOwnGame2013.html">Build Your Own Game link</a>.)</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>LARP Design and Writing using Querki</h3>
<h5>Mark “Justin” Waks</h5>
<p>Querki.net is a brand-new startup for managing information online, with the
first alpha release this month. It is designed for all sorts of information, but
it was originally built for writing LARPs -- keeping track of characters, plots,
items, factions, and anything else you need while building a game. This session
will be a hands-on demo, in which we show how Querki works by building a LARP
database.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Runtime GM for a weekend larp</h3>
<h5>Stephen Kohler</h5>
<p>So you're GMing a weekend long LARP. It's just like a minigame but longer,
right? Well, not really. Especially if you're the lead GM, running a weekend
long LARP after a minigame is like going from a Smart Car to a Formula 1
Racecar. And a lot of people haven't had a chance to experience the difference.
Fortunately for you, I have, and am here to give the benefit of my knowledge and
experience(or lack thereof) to you. Come and hear about dealing with handing out
packets for ~50 people, running a game over multiple days, having to be in three
places at once (and none of them where you are right now), and other joys of
GMing a weekend-long LARP, and what you can do to make your GMing life that much
better.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Star Crossed (larp)</h3>
<h5>Eric Wirtanen</h5>
<p>Tonight is the anniversary of the zodiac murders. Exactly twelve years ago,
twelve people were murdered all on one night. Tonight, the spirits of the fallen
rise and try to remember what happened to them ... and figure out where they go
from here.</p>
<p>Star-crossed is a two hour game for twelve players. Players will be taking
the roles of the murder victims in the zodiac murders. Their spirits have
awakened, somewhat confused about how they died and with fragments of what they
used to know of each other.</p>
<p>Expect a game of revenge, revelations, romance, forgiveness, and acceptance.
Characters have all been written as gender neutral and players can decide what
gender they want their character to be. That being said, there are romantic
relationships in the game. If you are uncomfortable with a same gender romance
plot, it might not be possible to avoid in a small game.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Skulduggery and LARP</h3>
<h5>Dave Inkpen, Dave Kapell</h5>
<p>In LARP, we often want to simulate various nefarious activities, like
lock-picking, stealth, and setting and disarming traps. Join us for a discussion
of techniques for implementing these systems in your LARP, what works or doesn't
work, real-world-skill vs character abilities and more.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Technical Tools for Larpwriting</h3>
<h5>Nat Budin, Mark “Justin” Waks, and more</h5>
<p>While you *can* write a LARP with nothing but text files, it can be a serious
hassle. So tools like Vellum and Querki have emerged, to make it easier to keep
all of that information organized and make game production easier. In this
panel, we will compare and contrast these tools and others, and talk about each
one's particular strengths.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Useful Handsewing Techniques for Larps</h3>
<h5>Lise Fracalossi, Matt LeVan, Mel Saunders</h5>
<p>Sometimes a sewing machine isn't available -- and sometimes it just isn't the
right tool for the job. Come to this workshop and learn some basic hand-sewing
techniques -- running stitch, hem stitch, slip-stitch, and maybe more. This is a
hands-on workshop aimed at sewists of all skill levels.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Writing and Larp-writing</h3>
<h5>Kevin Riggle, Lise Fracalossi</h5>
<p>Larps are a form of fiction, and so larp-writing is a form of fiction
writing, albeit a somewhat peculiar one. How does the larp form compare to other
fictive forms, and how does the experience of writing it? Which skills and
techniques transfer? How does your larp writing influence your other writing, or
not? How do the "publication" processes compare?</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Writing and Playing Compelling Villains</h3>
<h5>Chad Bergeron, Matt Brenner, Lise Fracalossi</h5>
<p>Man against nature, Man against self, Man against man. Conflict is the driver
of narratives, and every larp has them. It's easy to pit the players against an
outside force or give them inner angst, but it isn't always easy to write or to
play the other side of a Man against man narrative. But villains often prove to
be the most effective and interesting element in a story. How do you make sure
your villain is more like The Joker and less like Snidely Whiplash? Come talk
about what makes for an interesting villain, and how to convincingly play 
one.</p>
