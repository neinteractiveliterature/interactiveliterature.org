<h2 class="NelcoDayTitle">Friday</h2>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>7:30 PM: Death, Resurrection, Permadeath, and Replacement Roles</h3>
<p>Addressing the mechanical issues of the deaths of characters is an important
issue for most LARPs to consider. Some LARPs have systems for PCs to resurrect,
or to play on as ghosts or the undead. Some have "permadeath" and may allow
players to take on new roles as PCs or NPCs when it happens. Some LARPs create
systems to make sure death is rare, and some issue moratoriums against death
altogether for part or all of the LARP.</p>
<p>In this round table discussion, we'll be discussing various systems for
handling (or preventing) character death in all kinds of LARP, and their
benefits and drawbacks, and how to address the mechanics of death in a way that
works best for your LARP.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>7:30 PM: LARP Writing 101</h3>
<p>Presentation by Gaylord Tang</p>
<p>Over the course of the weekend, starting Friday night, we'll be running a
Build Your Own Game workshop. Whether you've never written a game, or are an
experienced author, it's a great time, and a great way to learn new techniques.
The LARP Writing 101 session will lay out the basics how to construct a LARP,
and start the process of imagining what kind of game will be written this
weekend.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>9 PM: Creating Plots that Players Want to Talk About</h3>
<p>How does one spice up a common plot, or add new elements to keep an ongoing
plot fresh and dynamic? In this round table discussion, we'll be talking about
what kinds of plots players will find most interesting and will give them lots
to chew over and chat about, both in and out of character.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>9:00 PM: BYOG Brainstorming</h3>
<p>Moderated by Gaylord Tang</p>
<p>The BYOG team start the writing process in earnest. People who aren't going
to be working on the BYOG are encouraged to come and to bring their ideas for
potential games they'd like to see written.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>10:30 PM: Group Dynamics in LARPs</h3>
<p>LARPs, by their interactive nature, are social experiences, which is why
group dynamics are a big part of LARPing. And they affect LARPs on multiple
levels, from players deciding which LARPs to play (and drop) based on who they
know will be playing or on staff, to how in-game factions function, to deciding
in-game whom to help and whom to hinder. In this round table discussion, we'll
be looking at how group dynamics affect our LARPs and how we can affect those
dynamics in a variety of ways, from our sign-up systems to in-game, inter-PC
mechanics.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="NelcoDayTitle">Saturday</h2>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>10 AM: Building Room Dividers</h3>
<p>Wouldn't some transportable room dividers that NEIL could lend out to LARPs
at Intercon and other events be super useful? Let's build some! NELCO will be
providing the materials.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>10 AM: BYOG Writing</h3>
<p>With a couple potential ideas on the board from last night, it's time to 
pick one and start fleshing it out. Over the span of the day (and probably all
night too), the BYOG team will create a new LARP.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>11 AM: NEIL Initiatives</h3>
<p>Presented by Nat Budin and Viktoriya Fuzaylova</p>
<p>In addition to putting on an annual LARP convention (Intercon) and an annual
LARP conference (NELCO) NEIL has some exciting projects in the works!</p>
<p><b>The LARP Library</b> is an online resource for free LARPs available for
anyone to run. Come learn how the Library works, including how to search for a
LARP to run and what kind of licenses are available, and be inspired to submit
your own!</p>
<p><b><i>Game Wrap</i></b> is a publication that will feature articles on LARP
as well as LARPs that you can run. The editors of <i>Game Wrap</i> will talk
about how the process is going so far and answer any questions you might
have.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>11 AM: Unusual Boffer Modules</h3>
<p>Moderated by Dave Kapell</p>
<p>There are a handful of common structures for modules in boffer campaign LARPs
that get used frequently, such as the Defend the Ritual Module, the Rogue
Module, and the Elevator Module. We also have a grabbag of common module
elements to toss into them, such as "jumpy stones", snap traps, puzzles, and
environmental hazards.</p>
<p>In this round table talk, we'll be discussing how to get creative with the
common structures, combine them in unexpected ways with various elements, and
twist them to keep players on their toes and create memorable experiences.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>12:30 PM: Let's Run a Big Showcase LARP</h3>
<p>Presentation by Cameron Betts</p>
<p>Several large LARP projects are currently attracting a lot of public
attention in the media, including 
<a href="http://www.cowlarp.com"><i>College of Wizardry</i></a>, a LARP set in 
a world similar to that of <i>Harry Potter</i> and run in a real Polish castle, 
and <a href="http://www.alternaliv.se/en/previous"><i>Monitor Celestra</i></a>, 
a LARP set in the world of <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> and run in a real 
warship.</p>
<p>Can we run a showcase LARP of our own right here in New England? Let's
brainstorm ideas!</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>2 PM: Campaigns: Writing and Running for the Long Haul</h3>
<p>Presentation by Rick Pierce</p>
<p>Campaign LARPs present their own set of challenges, unique from one-shots. In
this round table discussion, we'll be talking about the logistics of running
campaigns and how to create and run plots that will last and keep players
interested and involved for many events in a row. One of the LARPers leading
this discussion will be Rick Pierce, the creator of 
<a href="https://www.larportal.com/Index">LARPortal</a>, a website for
organizing, managing, and connecting campaign LARPs for staff and players.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>2 PM: Ideas for Showcase LARPs</h3>
<p>Moderated by Cameron Betts</p>
<p>Having discussed what big Showcase LARP is all about, it's time to brainstorm
what kind of Showcase LARP we could run in New England.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>3:30 PM: Inviting People into LARP</h3>
<p>Presentation by Stephen Kohler</p>
<p>How to Found and Run a College-based LARP Community ...even if you don't go
to college! Historically, colleges have been a hotbed of LARPs, with new players
and games often getting their start here before moving on to the wider LARP
world. But more and more people seem to be curious as to just how to start up a
LARP community at their local college. It's not always easy, but it certainly is
possible, and I'm here to tell you how. Or, at least to tell you all the things
I've learned not to do! With my help, you'll (hopefully) learn tricks of
recruitment as well as retention, including what games to run, when to run them,
and when to just run. Useful for any LARPer who wants to keep seeing the wider
LARP community spread and grow, and is willing to put in the work to help.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>3:30 PM: Boffer Archery</h3>
<p>Presentation by Bart Brizee</p>
<p>There are a handful of common methods of representing archery in live combat
LARPs. Some LARPs use throwing bird seed spell packets, some involve actually
shooting LARP-safe arrows. Come learn about the advantages and disadvantages of
the different methods, the different types of LARP-safe arrows out there, and
methods for maintaining safety, whatever you use. There will be live
demonstrations accompanying this outdoor event.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>5 PM: Videos From Around the LARP World</h3>
<p>In order to enable people who could not attend NELCO to participate, we
invited people to send short videos! We'll be compiling responses to send back
and keep the dialog going!</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>5 PM: LARP Forum and Five Minute Pitches</h3>
<p>The LARP Forum is an event that brings together people from the LARP
community in the greater New England area to hang out, talk about our hobby and
get to know each other. It has run multiple times as a standalone evening event,
and now will be running Saturday afternoon and evening at NELCO. Our goal is to
create a fun get-together which will bring people who love this hobby closer
together. Any LARP or LARP organization who wishes to host a table to introduce
new LARPers to their events is welcome to do so, at no extra cost beyond the
general NELCO admission fee. Anyone hosting a table is also welcome to give a
five minute pitch to the crowd to let everyone what they are all about, what
makes them unique, and how people can participate.</p>
<p>We'll be serving a catered dinner at the same time as the Forum. Come hang
with your friends from your game, meet new players and staffers from other
games, or even if you’ve never been to a LARP and you just want to check it out
— come and have a great time!</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>5 PM: Acting Workshop</h3>
<p>Run by Cameron Betts</p>
<p>In this workshop, we'll be running through some basic acting exercises that
we can do together and by ourselves to help us getting into in-character mode
and develop our acting skills for LARP.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>8 PM: Going Dark Responsibly</h3>
<p>Moderated by Laura Boylan</p>
<p>LARPs that focus on dark topics are often quite popular, but exploring our
darker sides with LARP necessitates an extra level of care on the parts of the
writers, staff, and players. In this round table talk, we'll be discussing the
inherent challenges of addressing dark topics in LARP, and how to do so
responsibly.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>8 PM: The Challenges and Advantages of Running at Night</h3>
<p>Moderated by Dave Kapell</p>
<p>In this round table talk, we'll be discussing what advantages and
disadvantages running LARPs outdoors at night presents. Let's talk about taking
advantage of the atmosphere, using creative and/or immersive lighting, and how
to take PC and NPC night-vision (and the ruining of PC and NPC night-vision!)
into account when planning your LARP event.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>8 PM: BYO Boffers</h3>
<p>In this workshop, we'll learn to build light, safe boffer weapons that hold
up to Accelerant standards. The workshop will cost an additional $20, but you’ll
get to take home a finished weapon at the end.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>11 PM: LARP Party</h3>
<p>Party Time! Hangout and party with NELCO!</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="NelcoDayTitle">Sunday</h2>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>10 AM: LARP Brunch</h3>
<p>Join us for breakfast for a free-form LARP-discussion brunch.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>Noon: LARP - Play in the BYOG</h3>
<p>They have worked all weekend to produce a LARP, and this is it. Sign up to
play the BYOG! Please arrive a little early so we can start on time.</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>3:15 PM: LARP - AGENT Bobo of the Resistance</h3>
<p>Run by Nat Budin</p>
<p>10-year-old Billy Oberlin has had it tough lately. Moving, family troubles,
and a new school have all thrown his life into a tailspin. It’s hard being a
kid, but Billy has one solace: his toy box. Twelve loyal stuffed friends he can
take on adventures through his imagination.</p>
<p>In the world of Billy’s creation, a secret Resistance movement fights against
evil invading dinosaurs, ninjas and aliens. Now on its riskiest mission yet, the
Resistance must travel back in time, to when things were better, to prevent
history from going so awry.</p>
<p>Can AGENT Bobo and his toybox friends help Billy find a better future for
himself and for the planet?</p>
<p><i>AGENT Bobo of the Resistance</i> is an experimental short larp, which won
third place at the Intercon M Iron GM Competition. It combines traditional
theatre-style larp structure with player-driven narrative construction. In
addition, players will be playing the role of Beanie Babies.</p>
