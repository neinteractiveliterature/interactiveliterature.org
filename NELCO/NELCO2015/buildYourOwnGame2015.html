<h3>Welcome to the Build Your Own Game track!</h3>
<p>You're going to help write a brand new LARP in 24 hours!</p>
<p>It's not as crazy as it sounds, and some really good games have come out of
these workshops. NELCO BYOGs have produced 
<a href="http://www.vortexofchaos.net/barbecue/home.html"><i>The
Barbecue</i></a> and 
<a href="http://www.vortexofchaos.net/princess_fluffykins/home.html"><i>The
Night Queen Princess Fluffykins Passed</i></a>, which have run several times,
including at Intercon. In 2000, 
<a href="http://www.vortexofchaos.net/collision/CollisionImminent.html"><i>Collision 
Imminent!</i></a> was created at a BYOG workshop, and it's run a dozen times
since then, across several conventions and events, spanning two continents. What
great LARP are you going to help create?</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>But how can you do this in such a short time, you ask?</h3>
<p>It's a challenge, and a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun. This is how 
we'll pull this off:</p>
<table class="byogScheduleTable" cellspacing="0">
	<tr>
		<th>When</th>
		<th>What</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Friday night</td>
		<td>Gaylord Tang (who has been part of every NELCO BYOG so far) will
		talk about the BYOG LARP creation process. You should plan on attending
		if you've never written a LARP before, or have never written with
		Gaylord before.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Later Friday night</td>
		<td>Everyone involved in the BYOG writing will gather to brainstorm
		ideas for the subject and style of the BYOG LARP. Bring your concepts,
		your character ideas, the styles of games you'd like to write, and what
		you really think should be in a LARP. Nothing is off the table - all
		ideas will be considered and discussed. Gaylord will facilitate the
		discussion as we figure out what excites the team, and what is doable
		within the time span. <i>The choice of what we write is decided by
		consensus - we pick something that everyone wants to work on.</i> Given 
		that consensus, we'll be ready for the morning.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Saturday morning</td>
		<td>Everyone gathers in the writing room, where we take the consensus
		concept and flesh it out. We'll design characters and plots, figure out
		the conflicts and how to create drama, think about the timing of the
		game, and outline what we're going to write.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Lunch break</td>
		<td>You can't write on an empty stomach.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Saturday afternoon</td>
		<td>We break down the game into the components that need to be written.
		People will choose what they'd like to write, and we'll figure out a
		plan so that everything gets done. We start writing. Each of us will
		take a piece and run with it, creating a part of the game. We'll all be
		in the same room, so you can work through any issues or brilliant ideas
		that come up as you create.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Dinner break</td>
		<td>You can't keep writing on an empty stomach, and it's always good to
		take a break. We'll also post a signup sheet, to see who wants to play
		in the game.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Saturday evening</td>
		<td>We continue writing. We collaborate. We help each other out. We look
		at each other's work, to make sure we have a consistent story, and to
		eliminate those pesky <s>tipos</s> <s>types</s> typos. When we're done,
		we'll print the game and all its pieces, look at the cast list and
		assign roles, and crash for a bit. It may be late when we're done, but
		it will be worth it when we look back at what we produced.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Sunday noon</td>
		<td>We run the game. You'll be the floor GM for a game that you helped
		to write, which is a very satisfying experience.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>But what about the rest of NELCO? That's a challenge, because we only have so
many hours to write. Your focus has to be on the BYOG effort. If there is one
particular panel that you really have to attend, then let's talk. Depending on
how many people are writing and how far we've gotten, it may be possible for you
to have an hour break.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>What do I have to do beforehand?</h3>
<p>That's easy:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sign up for NELCO, selecting the BYOG option.</li>
	<li>Fill out 
	<a href="https://secure.journeysurveys.com/answer/402/prompt">the survey</a> 
	to tell us more about you, so that we can better facilitate the event.
	Please do this, especially if you didn't select the BYOG option when you
	signed up. It helps us to know who intends to write.</li>
	<li>Collect your ideas and concepts, so that you can pitch them during the 
	brainstorming meeting.</li>
</ol>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>What do I have to bring to the BYOG?</h3>
<p>Not much:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A computer to work on. The hotel has free Wifi which we can use to share 
	information.</li>
	<li>A Google login. Google Docs is an easy way to collaborate on 
	writing.</li>
	<li>Something to drink. It helps to keep yourself hydrated during the
	effort, and the hotel vending machines aren't always working well.</li>
	<li>A willingness to work hard with a team of creative people.</li>
</ul>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>What happens to the game after NELCO?</h3>
<p>That's up to the team. Everyone will have access to the files. We will
undoubtedly learn things that need to be tweaked. We will learn things that we
need to put in the game packaging, so that it can be run again. The game belongs
to all of the authors, and good LARPs deserve to run again. Intercon is always
looking for good LARPs; we should consider bidding our efforts. Eventually, it
would be good to contribute the LARP to the 
<a href="http://library.interactiveliterature.org/">NEIL LARP Library</a>.</p>
<p>But first, we'll all get some needed sleep.</p>
