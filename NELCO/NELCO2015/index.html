<h3>What is NELCO 2015?</h3>
<p>The New England Larp Conference is a multi-tradition event focused on the
craft of LARP. It will be a weekend of LARP discussions, panels, workshops, and
build-your-own-games. As opposed to a gaming convention, the Conference will not
be a weekend of playing and running games, but will instead be discussion and
workshop based. If you've attended the Intercon Pre-con, that is the inspiration
for this event.</p>
<p>This year, Stephanie Davis is the NELCO Coordinator, and the core NELCO team
was Adina Schreiber, Cameron Betts, and Dave Kapell.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>The conference will happen at Camelot Cohousing in Berlin, MA. We do not have
a room block this year, but the three hotels listed below have available space
at reasonable rates. Staying at a hotel is not required to attend, and panels
and workshops will run until around 11 at night, while the Build Your Own Game
will run overnight.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>LARP Forum</h3>
<p>Saturday at dinner, we'll be hosting a LARP Forum.  Their 
<a href="http://thelarpforum.org">website</a> gives the following 
description:</p>
<ul>
	<p>The LARP Forum is an event that brings together people from the LARP
	community in the greater New England area to hang out, talk about our hobby
	and get to know each other. Our goal is to create a fun, annual get-together
	which will bring people who love this hobby closer together. Hang with your
	friends from your game, meet new players and staffers from other games, or
	even if you’ve never been to a LARP and you just want to check it out — come
	and have a great time!</p>
</ul>
<p>With Caroline Murphy's blessing, we're pleased to provide another venue for
this event. If you are interested in having a table for your game, please
indicate as much when you sign up for the event. There is no additional charge
for a table.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Build Your Own Game Workshop</h3>
<p>Over the course of the weekend, starting Friday night, we'll be running a
Build Your Own Game workshop. Whether you've never written a game, or are an
experienced author, it's a great time, and a great way to learn new techniques.
If you have any questions about this project, just drop us a line at 
<i>nelco AT interactiveliterature DOT org</i>.</p>
<p>The game will run on Sunday, so we're looking for people interested in
writing a new LARP as a team. If we have enough people interested, we'll split
into multiple teams, so please let us know ahead of time by signing up for the
"Build Your Own Game Author" flavor of attendee and filling out the survey. More
details can be found <a href="buildYourOwnGame2015.html">in this 
document</a>.</p>

<h3>Food</h3>
<p>We will be providing food to the attendees, including a cookout on Saturday.  
We'll add more details as we work them out.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Lodging</h3>
<p>As Camelot Cohousing has minimal guest rooms, there are three nearby (&lt; 2 
miles) hotels which we can recommend:</p>

<h3>Conference Rules</h3>
<p>For the most part we're a low-key conference, so there's not a lot here.
Mostly it boils down to "Don't be a dick". We do believe that all public events
should have an explicit harassment policy so:</p>
<p><b>Harassment Policy</b></p>
<p>NELCO and NEIL are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age,
religion, or any other factor. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
attendees in any form. Conference attendees violating these rules may be
sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of
the conference organizers.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
have any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference Senior Staff
immediately.</p>
