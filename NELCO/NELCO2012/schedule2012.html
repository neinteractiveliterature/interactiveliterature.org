<h3>8 PM: Intro to BYOGs - LARP Theory 101</h3>
<h5>Jeff Diewald</h5>
<p>So you want to write a LARP, and you're here for the Build Your Own Game
effort. Maybe you're just interested in what goes into creating a LARP, even if
you're not going to write. (Oh, c'mon. Give the writing a try!) Jeff Diewald has
written or cowritten more than a dozen LARPs in many different formats and
genres. He's given previous versions of this presentation to other BYOG LARP
writing efforts. Come listen to the interesting concepts and ideas that go into
his LARP writing process, to give you ideas on how you can improve (or start)
your own creative efforts.</p>
<p>You should attend this if you're going to take part in the Build Your Own
Game effort. You're quite welcome to attend if you're not going to take part in
the BYOG.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>8 PM: Character Writing: Writing LARP Characters of Distinction</h3>
<p>Writing LARPs is easy! Writing Characters for LARPs is hard! I've written
1000's of characters and, luckily for me, when I was finished writing
characters, the LARP was written as well. Great Characters with distinctive
backgrounds will write the LARP for you as long as you allow it to!</p>
<p>LARPs can be almost any genre, and can be short or long, but how do you
actually write a LARP? Well one strategy is to let it write itself by creating
distinctive characters with fascinating backgrounds!</p>
<p>Learn the techniques, resources, time limits, diversity and pitfalls of a
successful LARP Character Writer! There are ample tools to create awesome
characters. They can be drawn from everything from Historical Fiction to a Video
Game. There are at least as many models for characters as ideas in your mind.
We'll discuss the essentials of Character Writing and how to weave characters
into a story of great import that will guarantee fun for players!</p>

<h3>12 PM: Teaching LARP</h3>
<h5>Art 488: Special Topics: Live-Action Role-Playing</h5>
<h5>Alan Kriezenbeck's and Neal McDonald's class at UMBC Spring 2012</h5>
<p>Alan Kriezenbeck and Neal McDonald taught a LARP class last Spring at UMBC.
We will talk about running the class, what we taught, the games we looked at and
run, the people who enrolled, and what we'd do next time. Speaking will be
short, followed by discussion and feedback.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>12 PM: Game Wraps</h3>
<p>How do you summarize a game?</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>12 PM: Introduction to Sewing for LARP Costuming</h3>
<p>If you are a novice LARPer - or just a novice sewist - who wants to take
your costuming to the next level with needle and thread, this workshop is
designed for you. In this three-hour, hands-on workshop, you'll learn the basics
of designing a costume, selecting materials, reading a pattern, cutting the
pattern pieces, and finally, hand and machine sewing. The goal is to send you
home with a started sewing project of some sort, and the resources to complete
it on your
own.</p>
<p>Along the way - and guided by participant questions - we'll touch on some
of the special considerations of LARP costuming, such as making vs. buying,
modifying existing garments, the importance of pockets, and staying
comfortable.</p>
<p>Workshop participants are invited to come to class with a costume concept
they want to start on, and any materials they might already have. If you don't
have a project in mind, you can test out your newly-learned sewing skills on a
bag to carry your character packet in, or a caftan/tunic that you can
incorporate into a number of costumes.</p>
<p>Participants are welcome to bring sewing machines or any other portable tools
they desire. (Machines and other tools will be available, but availability might
be limited).</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>1 PM: Social Conflict and Bleed in Role-playing Communities</h3>
<h5>Sarah Lynne Bowman, Ph.D</h5>
<p>Have you ever wondered why some role-playing groups seem to experience large
amounts of "drama" no matter how hard the organizers and other players try to
keep the game enjoyable? Have you ever dealt with a "problem player" and found
yourself at a loss as to how to solve the situation? Have some of your fellow
players experienced emotional devastation as the result of in-game events or
out-of-game disagreements? Has your group experienced splintering, where
out-of-character factions developed? Did schisms occur, causing groups of
players to leave, some perhaps forming new "rival" games?</p>
<p>Based on two years of scholarly research and over thirty interviews - both
nationally and internationally - this lecture will explain some of the major
problems role-playing communities face in terms of social dynamics. I will offer
suggestions for diffusing conflict pre-game, during game, and post-game.
Personality traits and behaviors that disrupt player groups will be detailed, as
will behaviors that help enhance communal cohesion. Player cultures from the
U.S. and the Nordic countries will be contrasted. Come learn how to keep your
community vibrant and healthy!</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>1 PM: Combat Bubbles Suck: Redesigning Theater-Style Combat Mechanics for 
Immersion</h3>
<p>As theater-style LARPers, we value story and immersion -- we don't want
mechanics to get in the way of the choices that our characters are making and
the emotions that our characters are feeling. And then some character pulls out
a knife and game stops for twenty minutes while the players try to remember
their stats and calculate modifiers and the GMs figure out what happens.</p>
<p>This talk introduces some ways to design combat mechanics which require no
memorization or special equipment and which operate safely in near-real time
without requiring GM intervention.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>2 PM: Sets</h3>
<h5>Cameron Betts, Dave Kapell</h5>
<p>How to build sets that add atmosphere and ambiance to your LARP.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>3 PM: Write the Damn Wiki Already!</h3>
<p>One of the things that has come up in conversation is the idea of passing
along various bits of wisdom for the next generation of creatives. It's a great
idea. However, why not <i>collect</i> these <i>knols</i> in a manner that allows
them to be preserved and refined? <b>Perhaps, even distilled to best
practices!</b> So let's talk about why we should stop talking and start using
this weird thingie called the interwebs.</p>
<p>This was inspired by Lizzie Stark's "Write the Damn Rulebook Already" rant
at Solumkohta 2012.</p>
<p><b>Warning</b>: During this irreverent
conversation/discussion/rant, <i>we'll talk about why we should stop
talking.</i></p>
<p>Perhaps, we'll even cover why we should start documenting
(and exchanging information virtually) in an effort to preserve key truths such
as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>"Why are Bluesheets blue (and not green or pink)?"</li>
	<li>"Are game wraps necessary?"</li>
	<li>"Should I make sacrifices to Mike Young before I run my game for the 
	first time?"</li>
</ul>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>3 PM: And Then Ninjas Attack: Narrative in Larp</h3>
<p>Would you rather talk about fighting ninjas, or actually fight ninjas?</p>
<p>If the GMs have real ninjas attack, how does that improve the game? (Also,
what about the difficulties of hiring ninjas and retraining them not to kill
people awesomely?)</p>
<p>There's something to be said about the line between game fiction that happens
in the heads of players and fiction that plays out in the real world in a
visceral way. On the other hand, a purely "in world" game limits the scope of
what you can do. What are some of the limitations and affordances of playing
with that interstitial line that forms the boundary of the magic circle?</p>
<p>Plus, we'll talk about the "lenses" GMs use to create that fictional reality
that overlays our own. If we have time. We like to talk.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>4 PM: TV Tropes Storytelling Game Playtest</h3>
<p>You are authors in Tropespace competing to collect tropes for your next work
with which to tell the best story. Somehow everybody wants a Xanatos Gambit...
<i>Baron Munchausen</i> meets <i>Apples to Apples</i> with cards sourced from TV
Tropes. Still a bit beta, and very much looking for feedback, but hopefully
fun.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>4 PM: Introduction to building interactive props</h3>
<h5>Dave Kapell</h5>
<p>Learn to develop simple microcontroller-based props to enhance your games</p>
<p>Interactive props can aid immersion to some games. Learn how to create simple
digital circuits and the basics of microcontroller programming from Dave Kapell.
Experience with programming is useful, but I'll be tailoring the workshop to the
skill set of those interested.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>8 PM: The Mechanics of Running a Weekend-Long LARP or How to Lose Your
Sanity in 1 Easy Step</h3>
<h5>Stephen Kohler</h5>
<p>Ever wanted to run a weekend long LARP? Don't have the time or energy to put
together a weekend's worth of plot, but wanted to try your hand at GMing anyway?
Come and listen to one guy's way of making it happen!</p>
<p>So, you want to run a weekend-long LARP? WHY!?! Dear Lord, why!?! <i>Run!</i> 
<i><b>Run while you still can!!!!!!</b></i></p>
<p>Ok, now that we've scared off the lightweights, hi there! Once upon a time, I
was like you; I wanted to run a weekend-long LARP, but didn't know where to go
or what to do. So I set out on my own, and now I'm back to tell you how it's
done. I will work you through the logistics of acquiring a game, getting
together a GM team, getting players, casting, stuffing, and running the game, as
well as pointing out some of the classic pitfalls along the way. There will be
answers to your questions, and a good time will be had by all.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>8 PM: Does how we write affect how the game is played; Goal lists, Who you 
know, Background Stories</h3>
<h5>Cameron Betts</h5>
<p>How do these stock tools of LARP writing affect the outcome of the game?</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>9 PM: Baby Got Bustle: All About Victorian Booty</h3>
<h5>Lise Fracalossi</h5>
<p>Expand your knowledge of this late Victorian foundation garment with a
presentation on the evolution and construction of the bustle. Pictorial and
hands-on examples will be provided, and questions answered.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>9 PM: War Stories: LARPers are scum</h3>
<p>Join us for round-table storytelling and discussion of LARP experiences that 
didn't go quite how you expected.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>10 PM: Transmedia Techniques for LARP</h3>
<p><b><i>Transmedia.</i></b> When you hear the word <b><i>"Transmedia"</i></b>,
your first thought is <i>"Oh, that's a Hollywood buzzword. How would that ever
apply to LARP?"</i> It's a simple word attached to a complex concept. At its
core, it's just an umbrella idea about how to build a storyverse or storyworld
across different media. Even a LARP can use or has used these techniques. So
let's talk about some of these techniques as a way of enhancing and building the
story experience.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="NelcoDayTitle">Sunday</h2>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>12 PM: Play the Build Your Own Game</h3>
<h5>Run by a very tired group of game authors</h5>
<p>The Build Your Own Game team has been working since Friday to produce a game.
Come be the first players to play this new game!</p>
