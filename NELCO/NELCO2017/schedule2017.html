<h2 class="NelcoDayTitle">Friday</h2>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>7:30 PM to 11:00 PM LARP Social & <i>New World Magischola</i> Meet-Up (social hang out)</h3>
<p>A space for those who participated in any of the New World Magischola runs to
meet people from other weekends and reminisce about their time in wizarding
college. People who weren’t involved in NWM but want to socialize about other larp topics are welcome!</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="NelcoDayTitle">Saturday</h2>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>10:30am to 11:45am - Querki! LARP App (Presentation)</h3>
<p>This will be a presentation of the Querki LARP App, a full-featured application that lets you design, write, and manage Intercon-style games. It is highly collaborative, and provides rich features for not only writing character sheets, but understanding complex games while you are designing them.
</p>
<p>Presenter:  Mark Waks</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>10:30am to 11:45am - Running LARPs for Newbie Players (Roundtable)</h3>
<p>What are the elements that make a LARP a good choice to run for newbies? How does this change depending upon what kind of newbies one is running a LARP for? (New to a particular style of LARP? New to LARP but familiar with tabletop RPGs? New to any kind of RPGs?) What publicly available LARPs are there that best fit these criteria? What would an ideal-for-newbies LARP look like if we created it from scratch? And how can we adjust our GMing styles to accommodate newbies and maximize the odds of them coming back for more? Let's discuss these topics that are becoming increasingly important for the NEIL community. 
</p>
<p>Moderator: Adina Schreiber</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>12:00 to 1:15 - Forensic GMing (Presentation)</h3>
<p>When you run other people’s games, you get all their creative ideas, but also all their half-finished files.  Piecing it all together is the art of reading between the lines, knowing when to improvise and when to go your own way.  Let’s talk about how to deal with old file formats and how to reverse-engineer mechanics.  How do you figure out who should get which bluesheets, and what props are needed?  PANIC-controlling techniques available here.
</p>
<p>Presenters:  Stephen Kohler</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>12:00 to 1:15 - ARG!  The joys and frustrations of Alternate Reality Games (Panel)</h3>
<p>Most LARPs run with defined boundaries of in-game space (a conference room; a camp site)  and defined sessions (an evening; a weekend; a set of weekends)   Alternate Reality Games run without these boundaries.  What are some of the challenges and benefits of running across a city, state, or even across continents?  Where is the line between ARG and LARP?
</p>
<p>Panelists:  Caroline M , Monica G, Liam W, Henry W, Cam Betts</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>2:15 to 3:30 - Gender in LARP (Moderated Roundtable)</h3>
<p>Some games have gendered characters, in others the gender of the characters in left up to the players. Some have a mix of both. When should we use gender in a LARP? How can we best represent different gender orientations?  How can we use gender in our LARPs to enhance them?  
</p>
<p>Moderator:  Kim Sward</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>2:15 to 3:30 - Hour of Controversy (Micro-talks)</h3>
<p>Some great things start as controversial ideas that challenge the community’s thinking.  But these are hard ideas to voice.  The Hour of Controversy invites you to share a controversial idea (LARP related, please).  It will be short talks (1-5 min), and will not be followed by questions.  This is an opportunity for us to open our ears and our minds and listen to ideas that might challenge our thinking.  
</p>
<p>Moderators: Cam Betts, Tara Halwes</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>3:45 to 5:00 - GAME WRAP: Writing About Larp (Presentation)</h3>
<p>Game Wrap Magazine is NEIL's yearly publication specifically for discussing the art and craft of larp writing and running. Its special purpose is to take a critical, analytical look at how we approach the creative and technical aspects of live action roleplaying by soliciting articles from the surrounding community. Chances are, you might have an idea of how you can discuss larp in a manner that would be enlightening to fellow practitioners of the craft. But do you find the idea of writing an entire analytical essay too intimidating to submit? If so, this workshop aims to help people understand the process of approaching your idea in a critical manner that you can explain in the course of an article. The Game Wrap editorial team will walk you through how to go from idea to thesis to drafting support to organizing into a strong complete essay. Bring your ideas and questions and we're ready to help!
</p>
<p>Presenter: Phoebe R</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>3:45 to 6:30 - Cannibalism for Fun and Profit (a LARP brainstorm!) (Workshop)</h3>
<p>This provocatively named panel will involve participants taking their ideas from or for discarded games and sharing them in the hopes that others can make use of them.  Brand new ideas also welcome! Come with LARP ideas to pitch and discuss (or a desire to talk about other people's ideas).
</p>
<p>
This session runs from 3:45 to 6:30, but you don’t have to be there the whole time!
</p>
<p>Moderator:  Joe W</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>5:15 to 6:30 - The ins and outs of Sex in LARP (Presentation & Discussion)</h3>
<p>The time has come.  Lets have sex.  Now, how does this work, exactly?  LARPs have dealt with the mechanics of sex in a lot of different ways, some of which will be presented here for discussion. 
</p>
<p>
(Warning: this session may cause your LARP to improve its technique.)
</p>
<p>Presenter:  Cam Betts</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>8:30 to 9:45 - Flexible Casting in Theater LARPs (Roundtable)</h3>
<p>Having a flexible cast size in a LARP with pre-written characters has advantages, but it can be challenging to write enjoyable characters that are interesting and well integrated into the rest of the LARP, yet can also be left uncast. Let's discuss ways to write create LARPs whose minimum player number isn't the same as its maximum player number, but doesn't leave players feeling like they're "extras".
</p>
<p>Moderator:  Adina S</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>8:30 to 9:45 - NPCs and How to Write Them (Mini-talk and Roundtable)</h3>
<p>Almost every LARP has NPCs.  They are often written into the character backstory (in both GM-written and player-written games). Are we objectifying them and perpetuating negative stereotypes or unfortunate cultural behaviors or ideas? To what extent do we need to flesh them out and make them real characters, vs using them merely as foils for enhancement of the PC? Let’s talk about negative behaviors enacted upon others through the lens of anonymity, and ask writers to examine if they treat their NPCs similarly. 
</p>
<p>Presenter:  Megan Coppock</p>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>10:00 to 11:15 - Heavy Lies the Plastic Crown: Leaders & Authority Figures in LARP (Roundtable)</h3>
<p>Leaders and other roles with authority present a unique set of challenges as characters in LARPs, whether they're pre-written by a LARP writer or created by players. Action and plot in LARP often focus on rule-breaking shenanigans; how does a writer create a character who is "in charge" that will neither get steamrolled by the chaos, nor completely prevent the chaos from occurring? How can we influence the experience of leadership roles through mechanics or the writing in character sheets? As players, how can we effectively "steer" our roleplay as authoritative characters to create fun experiences for others? In games with player-written characters, how can a staff support authority created by players and ensure it remains a fun element for both the leader and the others?
</p>
<p>Moderator:  Adina S</p>

<h3>10:00 to 11:15 - Lessons from BYOG (Presentation and Discussion)</h3>
<p>Have you noticed anything missing this year? Since NELCO began in 2012, we have had a Build-You-Own-Game track at NELCO. (This year we are going to try to run it on a different weekend as an independent event.)  What have we learned about writing in a short format?  What makes a good idea for a weekend of writing?  Is there an ideal team size?
</p>
<p>Panelists:  Jeff D</p>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2 class="NelcoDayTitle">Sunday</h2>
<!------------------------------------->
<h3>11:00 AM to 1:00 PM: "Brunch at Moonstones!"</h3>
<p>Have brunch with other NELCO attendees at the Moonstones Restaurant in Chelmsford, MA.</p>
