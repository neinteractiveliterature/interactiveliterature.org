<h3>What is NELCO 2017?</h3>
<p>The New England Larp Conference is a multi-tradition event focused on the craft of LARP.  It will be a full day of LARP discussions, panels, workshops, and build-your-own-games. As opposed to a gaming convention, the Conference will not be a weekend of playing and running games, but will instead be discussion and workshop based. If you've attended the Intercon Pre-con, that is the inspiration for this event.
</p>
<p>This year, Cameron Betts is the NELCO Coordinator.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>The conference will happen at the Boxboro Regency in Boxborough MA.  We have arranged a number of rooms in a block with the rate of $129.  Staying at the hotel is not required to attend, and panels and workshops will run until around 11pm.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>The hotel has a restaurant, and typically attendees go en-masse to meals to continue discussions started in panels and swap LARP stories.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>
NELCO and NEIL are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or any other factor.

Conference attendees violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.
