A war hero, he is about to reach retirement without having been killed by any of his senior officers. Now on his final mission he must appoint a worthy successor before his ship is decommissioned and the crew transferred to the new prototype destroyer Venom's Bite. That has the crew uneasy. Korthon is transporting alien guests to a diplomatic conference on Regara VII. Earthers, Romulans, a Gorn no one seems able to communicate with, a Triskellion, and a Ferengi who's setting up a casino in one of the ship's storage bays. And that has the crew uneasy.</p><p>Except for disassembled weapon systems, rumors of witchcraft, picking up survivors from a Federation ghost ship, talking walls, and crew dissention this mission is sure to be a milk run. And that more than anything else has the crew uneasy.</p><p>We'll be using the Rule to Live By game system.

The archangel of technology does not want to step in and give humanity more technology to counter the demonic influence, starting a Celestial arms race on Earth; however, it may be the only way to defend against the growing threat.</p><p>Meanwhile, some of the archangels have taken to a religion, and instead of blaming Lucifer for the conflict, are blaming the other side. Of these archangels, most believe that Christianity is the only way, and that perhaps it is time to get humanity more attuned to God for once and for all.</p><p>God has remained silent, however, worrying some and motivating others to take action. Yves, the Metatron, has called the archangels together to decide what actions should be taken on these issues. But what can be done by the archangels if God remains silent, especially with such conflict in Heaven?<!---------------------------------------------------------------------></p><h3><i><a name="brawl">Brawl at the Broken Nose Tavern</a></i></h3><p><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>Catherine Preble and Mar-Vista Enterprises LLC<br><b>Players:&nbsp;</b>10-30</p><p>The Broken Nose Bar is frequented by rival Dwarves and Barbarians, one side for Dwarves and one side for Barbarians, including separate mugs and beer. Management hired a new barmaid, but didn't instruct her properly. Her first night, she cleaned and totally mixed everything from both sides of the bar.</p><p>The only way the owner of the Broken Nose Bar has been able to keep peace between his aggressive customers is to assure them the sanctity and privacy of their own side of the bar. When they arrive at the bar the next day after the new barmaid has mixed everything up, chaos occurs. How can the bartenders bring order back to the Bar, unmix the mixed up mess that the barmaid has left, and end the animosity and brawling between the Barbarians and Dwarves?<!---------------------------------------------------------------------></p><h3><i><a name="carpathian">Carpathian Night</a></i></h3><p><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>Humppaveikot<br><b>GM:&nbsp;</b>Juhani "Jussi" Eronen<br><b>Players:&nbsp;</b>15-18</p><p>A shadowy multimillionaire Juri Andropov has sent invitations to eccentric celebrities all over the world from his infamous mansion in Transylvania.

The secret that hides in Chelmsford is much less mundane and its consequences are much further reaching.</p><p>Nearly 300 years ago, the founding fathers of Chelmsford locked away an evil that could have destroyed mankind. This evil was sealed away in a holding vessel using ancient Native American magic and a medieval tome of arcane knowledge that has long since been lost to the ages. Upon sealing the vessel, it was buried in hallowed ground and protected by a mystical arcane rite.</p><p>As the years passed, the story of the bravery of the founding fathers faded into the stuff of legends and lore. What was once an accurate recount of fact turned into the ghost stories of the modern day mythos. As humankind reached into the 20th century, the tale was only used to frighten small children during Halloween celebrations.</p><p>It is said that the sins of the past often haunt the children of the future - this was recently proven true. During the excavation and widening of Route 3, a strange artifact was unearthed: an obelisk made from an unknown material. Embossed into it are strange symbols similar to Nordic runes. Believing that they had unearthed an ancient Nordic encampment, the town council called in resident experts from UMass Lowell and Miskatonic University. They were flabbergasted by the complexity of the craftsmanship and intrigued by the strange symbols, and they made the decision to contact more experts...</p><hr width="60%" align="center"><p>Welcome to "The Chelmsford Incident", a Cthulhu Live, Modern Day Interactive Event.

Anybody with a modicum of Astrological skill can try to tell you what it means when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are in alignment. That same person can tell you the meaning of a full Lunar eclipse, and of the Spring Equinox. These are all very well known phenomena. That all these portents are happening tonight, all at once, is unlikely to the point of breaking rationality, and nearly unfathomable. What IS truly strange, and odd to the extreme, are the sightings of extra suns. Some say there was a blue second sun at zenith at dawn, and it remained in the sky until noon. Others disagree, saying a red sun rose at noon, and still point to it. Such sightings could mean the end of the world as we know it, but perhaps it is just a universal bad hair day.<!---------------------------------------------------------------------></p><h3><i><a name="funkanomicon">Funkanomicon</a></i></h3><p><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>Philip B "Sir Noze" Tan <br><b>Players:&nbsp;</b>20-35</p><p>"Ha ha ha haaa!

Let me take your coat, the festivities will be taking place on the back lawn.</p><p>The year is 1965, and the country is in the throws of political and social change. Communism, civil rights, presidential assassinations and war are on the lips of every American. Today, however, local society is in the spotlight. Retired Senator Harold Brickshaw is throwing an 80th birthday party for his mother Geraldine, famous writer of the 1920s, and he has invited the entire Brickshaw family, close friends, and select members of the media to cover the well-publicized event.</p><p>Geraldine will not be the only focus of attention at this party. Marty Brickshaw, Harold's son, is a strong contender in the race for the US Senate. For weeks now, the media has been closely following Marty and his Democrat opponent. The race is close, and the media is looking forward to showing voters a more personal family side of the charismatic Republican candidate.</p><p>Geraldine's Birthday party is a LARP written for the intensive role-playing player. If you like getting into character and delving into a snapshot of history and social circumstance, this is the game for you. Characterization and social interaction are the focus of this game, and we encourage all who want to get into character!</p><p>While the setting in this game is historical, the characters and in-game events are not. Players are not, in any way, required to be history experts to play, but we do encourage you to brush up on your 1960s current events and bring as much into in-game conversation as you like.

At the time it was a brilliant entertainment. A hundred years and three major revisions later, it is a hopelessly dated and unplayable nightmare. "Clarence" is a LARP for by and about LARPers.</p><p>If you enjoy the interplay of player and GM, the folly of bad rules, weddings, time travellers, vampires, and other canned plots - in short pastiche of everything LARPish, this is the game for you. If you've played some of the "classic" LARPs so many times that you know each character by heart, this is the game for you.</p><p>"Clarence" is not a freewheeling anti-game in the style of "Hose-a-Rama" or "Flog-a-Thon," but rather an elaborate pastiche, requiring players to engage in a lively amount of cooperative metagaming in order to maintain conflicts and tension, while attempting to play the game. It is intended to be amusing and light, not a mechanics heavy "salvage the game" scenario.</p><p>For more details, see the<a href="http://www.vialarp.org/clarence/">Clarence</a> website.<!---------------------------------------------------------------------></p><h3><i><a name="panel">Panel -- the LARP</a></i></h3><p><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>Mark "Justin du Coeur" Waks <br><b>Players:&nbsp;</b>25-50</p><p>Today's panel will have the topic "War Stories -- Threats and Menaces".

There are a limited number of Panelist roles, for people who want to sit up at the front. And there are lots of Audience roles, for the various loons who get to drive the Panelists crazy. This isn't precisely a Horde game (Audience members will mostly have the same character for the whole time, and jump into the fray as appropriate), but is rather similar to one in style and tone.</p><p>So come attend our Panel, as we attempt to thoroughly explore the subject of "War Stories -- Threat or Menace?" in 45 minutes of mayhem.<!---------------------------------------------------------------------></p><h3><i><a name="prawn">Prawn</a></i></h3><p><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>Michael K "Buggy" Young <br><b>Players:&nbsp;</b>1-20</p><p>Welcome to The Tank.
