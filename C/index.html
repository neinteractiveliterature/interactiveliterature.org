<p>The theme of the sixth Intercon was a tongue-in-cheek look
back at the last "century" of LARP. There were more games at the 
con than in a long time, and more than two hundred LARPers to fill
them up. There were games that celebrated all sorts of different
styles, and games set in all sorts of different game periods. 
There was even a great display with a silly chronology of the last
hundred years of LARP, poking fun at a lot of the Usual (and 
Unusual) Suspects.</p>

<p>We always had a lot of fun doing

<h3><a name="good">A Good Day to Die</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> John "skykam" Kammer<br />
<b>Players:</b> 15-40</p>

<p>Captain Korthon is on his final voyage aboard the Klingon destroyer
<i>Raptor's Claw</i>. A war hero, he is about to reach retirement without having
been killed by any of his senior officers. Now on his final mission he must
appoint a worthy successor before his ship is decommissioned and the crew
transferred to the new prototype destroyer <i>Venom's Bite</i>. That has the
crew uneasy. Korthon is transporting alien guests to a diplomatic conference on
Regara VII. Earthers, Romulans, a Gorn no one seems able to communicate with, a
Triskellion, and a Ferengi who's setting up a casino in one of the ship's
storage bays. And that has the crew uneasy.</p>

<p>Except for disassembled weapon systems, rumors of witchcraft, picking up
survivors from a Federation ghost ship, talking walls, and crew dissention this
mission is sure to be a milk run. And that more than anything else has the crew
uneasy.</p>

<p>We'll be using the <i>Rules to Live By</i> game system. No experience with
the game system required - a rules briefing will take place before the game.</p>

<h3><a name="symphony">And the Symphony Played On</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Michael Bennet "Eager Mike" Wixon<br />
<b>Players:</b> 18-20</p>

<p>The forces of Hell are gaining an edge by giving humanity technology that it
is not ready for, advancing the arsenals of terrorists and allowing them to turn
religion against religion. The archangel of technology does not want to step in
and give humanity more technology to counter the demonic influence, starting a
Celestial arms race on Earth; however, it may be the only way to defend against
the growing threat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some of the archangels have taken to a religion, and instead of
blaming Lucifer for the conflict, are blaming the other side. Of these
archangels, most believe that Christianity is the only way, and that perhaps it
is time to get humanity more attuned to God for once and for all.</p>

<p>God has remained silent, however, worrying some and motivating others to take
action. Yves, the Metatron, has called the archangels together to decide what
actions should be taken on these issues. But what can be done by the archangels
if God remains silent, especially with such conflict in Heaven?</p>

<h3><a name="brawl">Brawl at the Broken Nose Tavern</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Catherine Preble and Mar-Vista Enterprises LLC<br />
<b>Players:</b> 10-30</p>

<p>The Broken Nose Bar is frequented by rival Dwarves and Barbarians, one side
for Dwarves and one side for Barbarians, including separate mugs and beer.
Management hired a new barmaid, but didn't instruct her properly. Her first
night, she cleaned and totally mixed everything from both sides of the bar.</p>

<p>The only way the owner of the Broken Nose Bar has been able to keep peace
between his aggressive customers is to assure them the sanctity and privacy of
their own side of the bar. When they arrive at the bar the next day after the
new barmaid has mixed everything up, chaos occurs. How can the bartenders bring
order back to the Bar, unmix the mixed up mess that the barmaid has left, and
end the animosity and brawling between the Barbarians and Dwarves?</p>

<h3><a name="carpathian">Carpathian Night</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Humppaveikot<br />
<b>GM:</b> Juhani "Jussi" Eronen<br />
<b>Players:</b> 15-18</p>

<p>A shadowy multimillionaire Juri Andropov has sent invitations to eccentric
celebrities all over the world from his infamous mansion in Transylvania. Mr.
Andropov has, seemingly on purpose, left the intention of the of the invitations
as a total mystery that will be revealed at the last moment.</p>

<p>Accept the invitation and board an old rusty train that will take you to the
village of Pijet deep in the heart of the Carpathian mountains. The trip will
continue through midwinter darkness along a lonesome road, at the end of which
lives the god-forsaken eremite, Andropov.</p>

<p>In brief: A Hammer-horror game (not VtM), in a current-day setting, using
no-rules-system.</p>

<h3><a name="chelmsford">The Chelmsford Incident</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Gregory Agostini and PST Productions <br />
<b>Players:</b> 20-25</p>

<p>Every town has its share of secrets: some may have a torrid past of
prostitution and gambling, others might have been involved in slavery. The
secret that hides in Chelmsford is much less mundane and its consequences are
much further reaching.</p>

<p>Nearly 300 years ago, the founding fathers of Chelmsford locked away an evil
that could have destroyed mankind. This evil was sealed away in a holding vessel
using ancient Native American magic and a medieval tome of arcane knowledge that
has long since been lost to the ages. Upon sealing the vessel, it was buried in
hallowed ground and protected by a mystical arcane rite.</p>

<p>As the years passed, the story of the bravery of the founding fathers faded
into the stuff of legends and lore. What was once an accurate recount of fact
turned into the ghost stories of the modern day mythos. As humankind reached
into the 20th century, the tale was only used to frighten small children during
Halloween celebrations.</p>

<p>It is said that the sins of the past often haunt the children of the future -
this was recently proven true. During the excavation and widening of Route 3, a
strange artifact was unearthed: an obelisk made from an unknown material.
Embossed into it are strange symbols similar to Nordic runes. Believing that
they had unearthed an ancient Nordic encampment, the town council called in
resident experts from UMass Lowell and Miskatonic University. They were
flabbergasted by the complexity of the craftsmanship and intrigued by the
strange symbols, and they made the decision to contact more experts...</p>

<p>Welcome to <i>The Chelmsford Incident</i>, a <i>Cthulhu Live</i>, Modern Day
Interactive Event. Come and discover the secrets of past and find out what lies
in wait from the shadows. Players will take on the roles of archaeologists,
scientists, the press, cultists, and members of an elite undercover agency
called Delta Green. Join your fellow players for a truly unique interactive LARP
event. Brought to you by PST Productions, North America's Premiere <i>Cthulhu 
Live</i> production team.</p>

<h3><a name="colonel">Colonel Sebastian T. Rawhide's Circus of the

<p><b>Author:</b> Michael K "Buggy" Young<br />
<b>Players:</b> 14-22</p>

<p>Join Colonel Sebastian T. Rawhide and his Circus of the Spectacular as they
return to America from their TRIUMPHANT tour of Europe where they performed for
Kings and Heads of State. But... The Circus is ailing financially. Can the
valiant members of the Circus save the show from the clutches of the nefarious
Bungling Brothers?</p>

<h3><a name="death">Death by Deatheast: Apocalypse Tonight?</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Chris Buck<br />
<b>Players:</b> 6-20</p>

<p>The portents are clear... as mud. Anybody with a modicum of Astrological
skill can try to tell you what it means when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are in alignment. That same person
can tell you the meaning of a full Lunar eclipse, and of the Spring Equinox.
These are all very well known phenomena. That all these portents are happening
tonight, all at once, is unlikely to the point of breaking rationality, and
nearly unfathomable. What IS truly strange, and odd to the extreme, are the
sightings of extra suns. Some say there was a blue second sun at zenith at dawn,
and it remained in the sky until noon. Others disagree, saying a red sun rose at
noon, and still point to it. Such sightings could mean the end of the world as
we know it, but perhaps it is just a universal bad hair day.</p>

<h3><a name="funkanomicon">Funkanomicon</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Philip B "Sir Noze" Tan <br />
<b>Players:</b> 20-35</p>

<p>"Ha ha ha haaa! I, Sir Noze D'Voidoffunk and the Nozes, am triumphant! Behold
the awesome power of the Trombipulation Army, Starchild! We're gonna tear the
roof of Intercon, so come out with your asses in the air and GIVE UP THE
FUNK!"</p>

<p>"This is Starchild to Funkenstein, uh, where's that beam-up at RIGHT
NOW?!"</p>

<p>This is a Dance Party Game based on the bizarre lyrics and liner notes of
Parliament/Funkadelic records. It parodies LARP game mechanics (<i>e.g.</i> the
currency of the game is 'Booty', ritual incants are choruses from P-Funk
tracks). Will Dr. Funkenstein manage to resurrect Clone Funk from the pyramids?
Will Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk prevail with the Placebo Syndrome, or will he realize
his own Funkentelechy? Who will stand in the way of the Atomic Dogs and Da
Bomb?</p>

<p>It's really just an excuse to gather from miles around to get down.</p>

<h3><a name="geraldines">Geraldine's Birthday Party</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Margaret E. Landreth <br />
<b>Players:</b> 15-20</p>

<p>You are invited to Geraldine's Birthday Party!</p>

<p>Welcome to the Brickshaw Estate, home of one of New York Society's most
wealthy, respected and prominent families. Let me take your coat, the
festivities will be taking place on the back lawn.</p>

<p>The year is 1965, and the country is in the throws of political and social
change. Communism, civil rights, presidential assassinations and war are on the
lips of every American. Today, however, local society is in the spotlight.
Retired Senator Harold Brickshaw is throwing an 80th birthday party for his
mother Geraldine, famous writer of the 1920s, and he has invited the entire
Brickshaw family, close friends, and select members of the media to cover the
well-publicized event.</p>

<p>Geraldine will not be the only focus of attention at this party. Marty
Brickshaw, Harold's son, is a strong contender in the race for the US Senate.
For weeks now, the media has been closely following Marty and his Democrat
opponent. The race is close, and the media is looking forward to showing voters
a more personal family side of the charismatic Republican candidate.</p>

<p>Geraldine's Birthday party is a LARP written for the intensive role-playing
player. If you like getting into character and delving into a snapshot of
history and social circumstance, this is the game for you. Characterization and
social interaction are the focus of this game, and we encourage all who want to
get into character!</p>

<p>While the setting in this game is historical, the characters and in-game
events are not. Players are not, in any way, required to be history experts to
play, but we do encourage you to brush up on your 1960s current events and bring
as much into in-game conversation as you like. Relevant web links will be
provided!</p>

information on the recent murders suggests that one of them may be the killer.
Could it be The Beast or the Wolf? Or perhaps it is something more sinister...
maybe one of the old Wicked Witches has returned?</p>

<p>It's a time to draw together, and defend the secrecy of Tales. Yet some see
this as a way to bid for power and overthrow the obviously ineffective Colian
regime. The murders must be solved and the murderer caught before the "normal"
authorities discover the existance of Tales. How is the Tale community going to
deal with the situation?</p>

<p>The base concept for this game was inspired by the new comic, <i>Fables</i> 
and many character are drawn from the Tales of the Brother's Grimm.</p>

<p>March 1, 1888: You are invited by Her Majesty's Parlour Adventurers to their
newest "acting evening". It's a chance to cast off stuffy England's inhibitions
and delve into exotic India, without ever leaving London. Will you be a

courtesan? Or a financier, who suddenly finds himself a jungle adventurer?</p>

<p><i>Her Majesty's Parlour Adventurers Present An Evening of Indian
Intrigue</i> is a brand-new game from Beth Kelly &amp; Alex Newman, the team
that brought you <i>Battle Beyond Infinity!!!!</i> and the psychological
thriller <i>Long, Cold, Night</i>. Players are guests at a Victorian gathering
&mdash; who are then cast in a game-within-a-game set in a mythical version of
India.</p>

<h3><a name="house">House on the Hill</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Brian Williams<br />
<b>Players:</b> 34</p>

<p>The "House on the Hill" on the scenic New England coast is the ideal location
for a short break or a long vacation. Yes, the old hotel did burn down 80 years
ago, shortly after opening, but we don't mention that to the guests. And those
men in the corner: the ones in the suits with the shades and suspicious bulges
under their jackets? Just guests, that's all. And the strange man with the
French girl dressed like they've stepped out of a silent movie? More guests. As
for the guy with the demented look in his eye, well he's the owner.</p>

<p>So, who in their right mind would come to the House on the Hill? Well, you'll
just have to play to find out. Two games in one, you can play in either 1923 or
2003. Described as a cross between <i>Dr Who</i>, HP Lovecraft and <i>Reservoir
Dogs</i>: do you want to find out what's in the cellar and why the place keeps
burning down?</p>

<b>Players:</b> 6</p>

<p>Humans, goblins, trolls and dwarves have fought for centuries; now the
monsters have sued for peace. Join us for the negotiations. Will the humans have
the upper hand? Will the monsters come out with the better settlement? Will the
trolls just eat everyone there? And what of the Monster Anti-Defamation League?
Humans vs. Monsters: Diplomacy is a silly game of negotiations, backstabbing,
politics, and rampaging trolls.</p>

<h3><a name="immortal">The Immortal Country</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Heather M. Jones<br />
<b>Players:</b> 10-20</p>

<p><i>The Immortal Country</i> is a fantasy LARP set amongst the ancient
civilization of Atlantis. Here gods war for power, professors seek tenure and
immortality, servants riot for equality, bewildered freshmen are trying to make
their way, and a group of scientists is growing concerned about the volcano in
the middle of the island.</p>

<p>Atlantis is an island ruled by Neanderthals, intellectuallly superior
creatures who have created a high and magnificent culture. Homo Sapiens are
'servants' with few rights of their own. Some people, however, have started to
get ideas -- that they should be equals.</p>

<p>A flurry of new religions seem to be springing up in the midst of this
chaotic mess. In the war amongst the gods, there are those who will do almost
anything -- even grant immortality -- to gain worshippers. Some of the gods,
however, seem very angry that any of the other gods are worshipped at all...</p>

<p><b>Author:</b> Eric K. Smith<br />
<b>Players:</b> 10-25</p>

<p>Ordinary mortals on a bus in the World Of Darkness. Better have life
insurance.</p>

<p>In the many World Of Darkness games, you play vampires or werewolves or mages
who control reality. In <i>It Sucks To Be You (Buses Unwelcome)</i>, you are
just some poor slob trying to survive and hold a day job in a world where people
are food/cattle/dream sources/etc. Your Ordinary Joe is taking a bus trip, but
where you get off is an open question. What fine denizens of the World Of
Darkness may find your blood, flesh, or souls tasty?</p>

<p>A high mortality rate is expected and pre-written backup characters will be
provided. You do not need to understand Mind's Eye Theater or the World Of
Darkness to play this game.</p>

<h3><a name="liberty">Liberty and the Price of Tea</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Jeremiah Genest<br />
<b>Players:</b> 25-39</p>

<p>In <i>Nobilis</i>, players take on the roles of the Sovereign Powers, each
the personification of one single aspect of reality: Night, or Roads, or
Ecstasy, or Chains. Once human, each character has been forever twisted and
changed by the addition of a single soul-fragment from their Lord or Lady
Imperator: giving them awesome power and terrible responsibility.</p>

<p>There is a set of very valuable and important Estates which are part of no
Imperator. No newly Commenced Power wields those Estates - instead, they are
given as rewards, as titles, to the best and the brightest of the Nobilis.
Liberty, beloved of the Wild Lords, bedrock of Creation, is one of these. The
Shield of Liberty has been held by the best and brightest that the Nobilis have
raised up century after century. And today that shield has no bearer. You, the
brightest of the Society of Flowers, have gathered together in the House on the
Hill to raise forth a new bearer.</p>

<h3><a name="malcor">Malcor</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Simon Deveau <br />
<b>Players:</b> 13-20</p>

<p>The planet Malcor has been virtually undisturbed since the time of its
discovery by the Imperial Scouts in 2250 Imperial Year. The entire planet,
cloaked in an impenetrable field of energy that defied the Empire's most
powerful weapons has remained out of the Emperor's grasp for 250 years. Now a
plague is sweeping through the Empire, threatening to extinguish all life in the
galaxy and the Emperor's advisors have told him the location of the only
possible cure is Malcor. Through deft diplomatic measures the Emperor has
secured for the first time ever a meeting between his representatives and the
seemingly very technologically backward "rulers of Malcor" to negotiate for the
substance that will save the Empire. The meeting will take place on Malcor at
the Castle Tannus, home of the Emerald Prince and Priestess rulers of the
Emerald Kingdom. Players will join the event as members of the Imperial team and
the inhabitants of Malcor. They will participate in the formal negotiations on
the surface of Malcor that will hopefully save the galaxy.</p>

<h3><a name="ravenholt">NERO Ravenholt: Isle of Desolation</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Rachel Morris and the NERO Mass Staff<br />
<b>Players:</b> 6-30</p>

<p>Since Prince Kevynn Blackfox decreed that His Grace, Duke Roderick Ravenhurst
would be the sole and single ruler of Ravenholt and that former Duke Maximillian
Greystone be relegated to his new role as Prince's Knight in Evendarr City,
political tensions around the Duchy have gradually been easing. The people of
the land can once again see to their borders as concerns are raised about
neighboring Expansion Territory 13 to the south, believed to still be under
Sessai rule, and Draelonde to the northeast, as rumors abound about Dark Elves
on the move.</p>

<p>In the meantime, reports of undead abominations - Liches, Vampires, and Death
Knights - are becoming more prevalent, and business is good for area weapon
smiths selling silvered and magical weapons, while casters are creating Stakes
of Woe in the hopes of vanquishing at least the Lesser Vampires. Periodic
sightings of these vile creatures have been reported from all four Baronies over
the last year, and children and adults alike have been disappearing.</p>

<p>It is during the difficult winter season, where boats' travel is limited to
nearby islands, when the captain of a fishing scow out of Byrne's Cove in the
Barony of Capulus, Ravenholt, has discovered something amiss on a small island
off the coast. The little island community of Byrne's Bane stands empty ...
or is it? Now a party of adventurers is being gathered to discover what's 
amiss. Will you have the strength of blade, power of magic, or stealth to aide 
in the mission?</p>

<h3><a name="original">The Original 1903 LARP &mdash; "An Evening With 
Clarence"</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Gordon Olmstead-Dean<br />
<b>Players:</b> 17-32</p>

<p>In 1903 the first LARP ever - <i>An Evening With Clarence, an Entertainment
for Six to Twelve Gay Couples</i> - premiered at the Cleveland Hotel. At the
time it was a brilliant entertainment. A hundred years and three major revisions
later, it is a hopelessly dated and unplayable nightmare. "Clarence" is a LARP
for by and about LARPers.</p>

<p>If you enjoy the interplay of player and GM, the folly of bad rules,
weddings, time travellers, vampires, and other canned plots - in short pastiche
of everything LARPish, this is the game for you. If you've played some of the
"classic" LARPs so many times that you know each character by heart, this is the
game for you.</p>

<p>"Clarence" is not a freewheeling anti-game in the style of <i>Hose-a-Rama</i>
or <i>Flog-a-Thon</i>, but rather an elaborate pastiche, requiring players to
engage in a lively amount of cooperative metagaming in order to maintain
conflicts and tension, while attempting to play the game. It is intended to be
amusing and light, not a mechanics heavy "salvage the game" scenario.</p>

<a href="http://www.vialarp.org/clarence/">Clarence</a> website.</p>

<h3><a name="panel">Panel &mdash; the LARP</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Mark "Justin du Coeur" Waks<br />
<b>Players:</b> 25-50</p>

<p>Today's panel will have the topic "War Stories -- Threats and Menaces". The
distinguished slate of six panelists are drawn from diverse backgrounds,
covering all aspects of LARPing. They will discuss the subject, and field
questions from the audience.</p>

<p>Well, that's the theory, anyway. Join us for a satire of LARPs and panels, in
the one-hour micro-game "Panel &mdash; the LARP". There are a limited number of
Panelist roles, for people who want to sit up at the front. And there are lots
of Audience roles, for the various loons who get to drive the Panelists crazy.
This isn't precisely a Horde game (Audience members will mostly have the same
character for the whole time, and jump into the fray as appropriate), but is
rather similar to one in style and tone.</p>

<p>So come attend our Panel, as we attempt to thoroughly explore the subject of
"War Stories &mdash; Threat or Menace?" in 45 minutes of mayhem.</p>

<h3><a name="princes">The Prince's Diamond Jubilee</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Dean Edgell<br />
<b>Players:</b> 25-31</p>

<p>Come Visit Night City.</p>

<p>But beware. For in its sewers and dark alleys and yes, in its theatres and
office towers, lurk the powerful undead - Vampires. They do exist. They
manipulate us, use us, and feed upon us. They are there, just out of sight,
hidden by... the Masquerade.</p>

<p>The vampire Prince of Night City has ruled his domain for sixty years. Those
who have dared to challenge his power have paid the price. But sixty years is a
long time, even amongst the ageless undead. There are those who whisper that the
Prince has fought one battle too many, that his strength has been exhausted, and
that he can no longer enforce the Traditions.</p>

<p>Now the Kindred of Night City gather at their Prince's command to Present
themselves in honor of his Diamond Jubilee. The occasion may honour the past,
but the Kindred will come to witness the future.</p>

<p>The Prince's Diamond Jubilee is a live action roleplaying game set in White
Wolf's World of Darkness. The Kindred of Night City gather in celebration of
their Prince's Diamond Jubilee, and to pursue their own quests for power, love
or hope. You can play one of the vampires of Night City, and help determine the
course of future events in that city.</p>

<h3><a name="saturday">Saturday Morning Massacre</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Alex Bradley<br />
<b>Players:</b> 15-26</p>

<p>It is a beautiful Saturday morning, and all is well in your world. The birds
are doing what birds do, the trees are doing what trees do, and you are waiting
for the commercial break to be over, so you can do that thing you do: be a
cartoon. All is going according to script... or is it? Suddenly everything has
changed, people look different, places are unfamiliar, even physical laws seem
oddly distorted. In fact, nothing's the same anymore. Your world has vanished
without a trace! Of course, you don't know you're a cartoon character. You're
just a perfectly normal person. Who fights evil, or maybe propagates it, on a
global scale. You know, normal. You were minding your own business, and now
you're thrust into this strange new world with no clear idea how you got here.
Come to think of it, this place may not be that safe... The world is in peril!
Destruction is everywhere! Should you save it? Or destroy it? These are the
choices you must make, in the Saturday Morning Massacre!!! You play a 1980s
cartoon character. Apply early for maximum flexibility in casting. Bring out
your inner child, and inflict it on others. Start thinking INSIDE the Box.</p>

<h3><a name="school">The School for Young Women Specializing in the Arts of
Grace and Maidenly Submission</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Kreg Segall<br />
<b>Players:</b> 25-39</p>

<p>It is the night before the charm school girls are due to be wed to a bunch of
awful, awful, blotchy old rich guys, as is mandatory for all graduates of the
"School for Young Women Specializing in the Arts of Grace and Maidenly
Submission." Perhaps the swashbucklers from the two rival fencing schools (The
Scarlet Pimpernel's' School of Fencing and Fair Play, and the Mummy Pirate
LeChuck's School of Yar!) can rescue these girls from a fate worse than death.
The game takes place in the great field between these three establishments where
the two fencing schools are having their annual tourmament and final exam.</p>

<p>The characters will all be assorted well-known swashbuckling gallants,
infamous pirates, and demure (not so demure) women for a night full for fencing,
romance, and mischief in the moonlight.</p>

<h3><a name="symposium">Symposium</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Paul S. Dwyer<br />
<b>Players:</b> 4-8</p>

<p>What does Theodore Roosevelt have to say to Cleopatra and Karl Marx about
politics and culture in their days and ours? Can H. G. Wells explain the faults
of the modern world to Elanor of Acquitaine? Why not come to dinner and ask
them?</p>

<p>Choose from our menu of interesting and important characters from history and
represent their achievements and ideas at a dinner party of other significant
names. Inspired by Steve Allen's show <i>Meeting of the Minds</i> and Plato's

<h3><a name="those">Those Who Serve</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Andrew W "Andy" Kirschbaum <br />
<b>Players:</b> 25-40</p>

<p>It is 5,000 years since humanity has conquered space. Under the watchful eye
of the all-powerful and immortal Emperor, mankind has thrived on countless
worlds.</p>

<p>The peace between these worlds had long been maintained by the Servitors,
elite guardians of the Empire specially trained to harness the power of their
souls as weapons. 1,000 years ago though, the Emperor lost interest in the
future of man and retreated to the Imperial City, a gigantic starship that
houses the Emperor's court. Without his leadership, the Empire was plunged into
a millennium of bloody war as numerous warlords arose and began building their
own petty fiefdoms.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, there is a chance for a return to the peace of older
days. The Emperor has issued a summons, inviting all of the warlords to meet
with him aboard his ship. Though his power has been weakened, it is an
invitation that can not be ignored. What has happened to rouse the Emperor from
his indifference and will the warlords be able to navigate the complicated
etiquette of the Imperial City?</p>

<h3><a name="underdogs">Underdog's Tavern</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b> Kelly and Jim MacDougal<br />
<b>Players:</b> 15-25</p>

<p>Welcome to Underdog's tavern and the annual Good Guys/Bad Guys Fete.</p>

<p>Every year all the Supers on both sides of the fence come together to let off
steam and have a little fun. This morning was the black/white softball game.
Once again the Chicago suburb of Inverness has survived with only minimal damage
to the park grounds where the game was held. It was record year for the balls
though, one hundred and forty balls were needed for the twelve inning game;
that's eighteen more than the previous record.</p>

<p>This year's fete is being held at Under Dog's Tavern. Under Dog's is run by
Galen Tweak a long time friend and fan of Super Heroes. There is one hard and
fast rule for tonight: No one may attack or otherwise use their powers against
another in the bar. Tonight is about detente. There are always a few brave or
foolish souls who try to push this rule, but Galen is far stricter than Blackie,
the owner of Blackie's Tavern. Everyone needs to be on their best behavior.</p>

<p>There are a number of events scheduled for tonight. So everyone needs to come
with their best friendly face as they set aside personal problems for an evening
of fun.</p>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3><a name="welcome">Welcome to Scearbridge: A Unique College
Experience</a></h3>

<p><b>Author:</b>  Susan Weiner<br />
<b>Players:</b> 20-32</p>

<p>How does the idea of a college with no classes sound? Scearbridge College is
just that, an experimental college, which attracts the best and the brightest to
its very different approach. The school has been continuing for years, and only
about half the students ever leave. Heck, many don't even bother to 
graduate.</p>

<p>Every month, a few new students arrive, and this is the starting day for four
new students, a punk, a nerd, a rich actor's child, and a budding musician. The
rich actor's child is being trailed by a reporter, who saw their entry as the
perfect time to do a human interest story on the college.</p>

<p>But something strange is happening, and nobody quite seems to know what's
going on... except maybe Hiram Scearbridge, the eccentric old man who started
the school 30 years ago.</p>

<h3><a name="youll">You'll Be Safe Here</a></h3>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacqui Antonelli, Jeff Diewald, Susan Giusto, Tim Lasko, and
Barry Tannenbaum<br />
<b>Players:</b> 10-13</p>

<p>The danger was imminent, a threat you could not possibly handle. There was
shouting, confusion or danger. A familiar, friendly voice told you, "You'll be
safe here." And there was a doorway, a space, a crevice that led away from the
trouble. You went through it, then, you don't know how, you ended up in this
place. You're not sure where this place is. It is not at all what you expected.
And there are several others here who look just as confused as you...</p>

<p>TNT Productions presents <i>You'll Be Safe Here</i>, a dramatic study for
twelve unrelated characters, who think they've reached sanctuary. Instead,
they've found themselves together in a place completely outside of their
expectations. Their original companions are still in danger and will need their
help. Will they be able to work together to find their way back?</p>

<p>Are they really safe here? And... just where are they?</p>
