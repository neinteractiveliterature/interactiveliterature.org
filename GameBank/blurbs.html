<h1>Writing a Good Blurb for your Submission</h1>
<p>A blurb is the relatively short description that you write for your LARP, in
order to tell the people who want to run a LARP what your LARP is about. The
blurb is also how the people who download your LARP are going to advertise the
LARP to their potential players. A strong blurb will increase the demand for
your LARP. A weak blurb will mean your LARP just doesn't get downloaded that
often, regardless of the quality of your LARP. (Note that this advice also 
applies to blurbs for games running at conventions like Intercon and 
elsewhere.)</p>
<p>You've spent all that time creating and crafting your LARP. It deserves a
strong blurb. A strong blurb has to do four important things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>It has to tell the player about the setting, style, tone, genre, and
		the kinds of characters in the game. This part of the blurb sets the
		initial expectations for the LARP. For example:</p>
		<div class="referenceNote">
			<p><b>Deep Fryer Nine</b></p>
			<p>On the edge of a space-time anomaly that leads to the far side of
			the Galaxy, space travelers come to Deep Fryer Nine in all shapes,
			sizes, and metabolisms - and theyâ€™re HUNGRY.</p>
		</div>
		<p>This tells the player it's science-fiction, set in a diverse
		Universe, with a hint of silly.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>It has to tell the player what their character might be doing during
		the LARP. The part of the blurb sets the character expectations for the
		player in the LARP.</p>
		<div class="referenceNote">
			<p>Unfortunately, the sentient AutoChefBot is on strike, demanding a
			pay raise. The ever-logical manager seems to be slipping into <u>pon
			farr</u>. Whatever burst from the chest of the cashier is scuttling
			on top of the condiments table. The Cardassian Sisters are capturing
			it all on vid for their reality pilot. There are Colors From Space
			in the drive-through, and the <u>spoo</u> has gone bad.</p>
		</div>
		<p>This tells the player about the kinds of characters in the game: 
		the AutoChefBot, a Vulcan manager, reality vid stars, and customers in
		the restaurant. The game is a mashup of <i>Star Trek</i>, <i>Alien</i>,
		Lovecraftian horrors, and <i>Babylon 5</i>. It's clearly silly, there 
		are a wide range of characters, and it would not be out of place for
		Cthulhu and Arthur Dent to show up for a lunch meeting.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>It has to tell the player what they will be doing as a player in the
		game. This part of the blurb sets the player expectations. Setting
		player expectations includes trigger warnings - things that might cause
		the player distress.</p>
		<div class="referenceNote">
			<p><u>Deep Fryer Nine</u> is a frenetic Horde game set at the last
			fast-food restaurant in the Upsilon Sector! Play one of the staff or
			many of the strange and alien customers who just want it 
			<b>their</b> way.</p>
			<p>Trigger warnings include: characters being eaten whole, insanity,
			fictional drug addiction, giant mutant spiders, and liberal use of 
			fake blood.</p>
		</div>
		<p>This tells the players that it's a Horde game, which sets clear
		expectations about the style of play. The players will either be staff
		or customers in a restaurant, which is straightforward.</p>
		<p>While these trigger warnings might seem silly, going along with the
		style of the blurb, some are real things that might upset or unnerve
		some players. It's best to err on the side of safety.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>It has to sell the player on the LARP, getting them interested in
		playing, both as a character and a player.</p>
		<div class="referenceNote">
			<p>Deep Fryer Nine: Our last, best hope for grease!</p>
		</div>
		<p>With a memorable tag line that's also a play on a <i>Babylon 5</i> 
		reference, added to the amusing details in the second paragraph, this is
		a blurb that would attract people.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>There are some things a good blurb doesn't do:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>It doesn't focus on just one character. While one character can be
		the focus of the blurb, the blurb has to give a sense for the others in
		the cast. For example, if the High Queen is upset and gathering her
		subjects, it would help to know what kind of subjects (nobles? peasants?
		consorts? advisors?) are being gathered, and why.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>It doesn't lie. Many GMs think they are clever when they write a
		blurb that describes one game, then run a completely different LARP.
		This can really anger the players; it's a "bait and switch" that rudely
		violates the player's expectations.</p>
		<p>Having Cthulhu unexpectedly show up in <i>Deep Fryer Nine</i> would
		not be a surprise. Having Cthulhu unexpectedly show up in a serious
		historical period piece set at a Victorian tea party would probably
		break all the expectations of the game.</p>
		<p>It's acceptable to have surprises in games, as long as the players
		have a serious hint that the LARP is not what it seems. Over the years,
		Intercon has seen a few of these kinds of unexpected switch-ups. Most of
		them have resulted in a lot of disappointed and upset players.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>It doesn't contain spelling mistakes, bad grammar, or incomplete
		sentences unless that's a deliberate stylistic choice for <i>a part</i>
		of the blurb. If the entire blurb is poorly written, it suggests
		(rightly or wrongly) that the game may be poorly written.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The blurb is usually the first thing that a potential player sees. A good
blurb will bring the players to the game. A bad blurb pushes them away.
