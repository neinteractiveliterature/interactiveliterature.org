<h1>Using the Game Bank</h1>
<p>The goal of the NEIL LARP Game Bank is to encourage and grow LARPing where we
can. NEIL - New England Interactive Literature - 
<a href="../NEIL/index.html">does a lot of LARP-related work</a>; the LARP Game
Bank is one way of making LARP more accessible and available.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>What is LARPing?</h2>
<p>There's 
<a href="http://www.interactiveliterature.org/P/Static.php?page=faq">a FAQ</a> 
for that!</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Where do LARP Game Bank LARPs come from?</h2>
<p>These LARPs come from the talented and clever work done by many authors, in
many different LARP genres and styles. These LARPs represent a lot of time and
effort by those authors, who create interesting characters, challenging
dilemmas, and engaging settings that pull everything together into a game for
players to enjoy.</p>
<p>There are three main sources for the LARPs in the Game Bank:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Many LARPs in the Game Bank have been submitted by authors for
	inclusion, so that their efforts will run again. It can take a lot of work 
	to create a LARP; good LARPs should be run again and again, so that they
	can be enjoyed by new players.</p></li>
	<li><p>NEIL, and LARPA and the ILF in the past, sponsor 
	<a href="../NEIL/larpWritingContests.html">Iron GM and Small Game 
	contests</a>, where authors are challenged to write something brilliant in a
	short time. This has produced many memorable results.</p></li>
	<li><p>NEIL runs <a href="../NEIL/byogSeminars.html">Build Your Own Game
	seminars</a>, where a mix of new and experienced writers craft a new LARP in
	24 hours. This has also produced many memorable results.</p></li>
</ol>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>How do I pick a LARP that's interesting to me?</h2>
<p>The Game Bank contains a growing collection of LARPs. It is our goal that you
should be able to find something that appeals to you and your group of players.
If not, then please consider helping us <a href="submissions.html">to find 
something new</a> that fits your needs.</p>
<p>Searching the Game Bank depends on what you're looking for:</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>I've heard about LARPing and want to try it</h3>
<p>Great! Welcome to LARPing. Think about starting smaller, with a simple LARP.
Check out the detailed information to find those LARPs that are easier for new 
people to play and run.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>My group likes to LARP, and we're looking for something to play</h3>
<p>You've come to the right place! You know your group, so look at the genres
and styles that your group might enjoy. It's also interesting to pick something
out of the usual, to explore some of the other dimensions of LARP.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>My convention/gathering needs LARP events to run</h3>
<p>Please tell us about it! Every convention is different, but we
<a href="../NEIL/interconConventions.html">know something about running 
them</a>. If your convention allows pre-registration to events, so that GMs can
get characters out to players well before the con, then you can pick from the 
entire list. If your convention allows registration at the door, so that you 
can't cast beforehand, then your choices are more limited. Look for LARPs that
don't have large amounts of material for players, or for those that hand out
materials during the LARP, so that you don't overwhelm the players when they
get to the game.</p>
<p>If the convention that needs LARP events 
<a href="../NEIL/interconConventions.html">is Intercon</a>, then you probably
know the challenge we have finding enough LARP events to handle the crowds at
our door. Please consider running one of these games for Intercon, because there
are sure to be a lot of players who haven't played the LARP yet.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>I need a LARP for a party or some special occasion</h3>
<p>Congratulations! While there aren't many LARPs that are occasion-specific,
there are some that are quite useful for a party. Look for something light and
silly, with opportunities for outrageous costuming.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>I'm thinking about writing a LARP - how is it done?</h3>
<p>We have what you need to learn! We run 
<a href="../NEIL/byogSeminars.html">seminars on how to write LARPs.</a> The 
seminar page also has pointers to some of the seminar materials. When you're
done with them, pick a couple of different LARPs from the Game Bank and see how
they're constructed. When you've run your LARP a couple of times, and have
worked the bugs out, consider <a href="submissions.html">giving back to the next
new author</a> that follows in your footsteps.</p>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Will someone run this LARP for my group?</h3>
<p>Maybe, if you ask nicely! There is contact information on the detailed 
descriptions of the LARPs in the Game Bank. Some of these authors are known to 
run their creations for someone else. There are also those in the New England
LARP community (and beyond) who love running LARPs, even those by other 
authors. Be aware that many of these people are already working on their next
effort; they've put their LARP into the Game Bank for others to run - so why
not you?</p>
