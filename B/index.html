For a long time, you could see some of the really outrageous B-movie 		costumes on the commercials for "Chowdah", a local videomagazine on		AT&amp;T's local access channel. 		<p>Intercon B suffered from troubles with the economy, and was the 		smallest of the Northern Intercons to date. Still, small is relative.		With 159 people at the con, it was still a good sized Intercon 		and a lot of fun. It's tough to beat a collection of four tracks		of LARPs gathered for an Intercon, especially when written by some of 		these LARP authors.		</p><p>		<table border="0" cellspacing="2"
