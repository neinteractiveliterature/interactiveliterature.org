			<p>The fifth Intercon was the third at the Chelmsford Radisson. The
			theme was "B movies", and several of the games fit right in. For a
			long time, you could see some of the really outrageous B-movie
			costumes on the commercials for <i>Chowdah</i>, a local
			videomagazine on then-AT&amp;T's local access channel.</p> 
			<p>Intercon B suffered from troubles with the economy, and was the
			smallest of the Northern Intercons to date. Still, small is
			relative. With 159 people at the con, it was still a good sized
			Intercon and a lot of fun. It's tough to beat a collection of four
			solid tracks of LARPs gathered for an Intercon, especially when
			written by some of these LARP authors.</p>

<b>Players:</b> 25-39</p>
<p>Riven by 230 years of Civil War, Cardolan has one last chance for peace and

<p>The Cardolani Succession is a game of politics and negotiation, set in
Tolkien's Middle-earth in 1638 TA. Take the role of one of the Noble Houses of
Cardolan, battling for control of the throne, or one of her allies, trying to

<h3><a name="generation">Generation Gap</a></h3>
<p><b>Author:</b> Andrew Warren Kirschbaum<br />
<b>Players:</b> 10-20</p>
<p>Even the immortal Vampires of the Inner Council notice the passing of time.
Technology and attitudes have changed so dramatically from their living days,
that these ancient monsters can no longer understand, let alone control, the
world around them.</p>
<p>A radical experiment has been proposed: A small group of young and
inexperienced vampires have been given control of a small town in the
mid-western United States. They will be responsible for controlling the mortals
in their herd. They will protect the Masquerade. They will keep the Traditions.
And if they fail, they will die and the town will be wiped from the face of the
earth.</p>
<p>Can you and your fellow High Generation, recently embraced Kindred, meet your
greatest challenge ever? If you succeed the glory and the power of the ages will
be yours. If you fail... you will be dust.</p>

<b>Players:</b> 3-8</p>

William's dagger. Apparently he sold it at market in Shantytown this morning.
There's no time for preparation - you're told to hurry, be discreet, but be
ready to use force where necessary. Hah! As if the scum of Shantytown would dare
to raise weapon against you.</p>
<p>This module is an introduction to the LIONE LARP and its combat system.

<h3><a name="shut">Shut Up and Play Your Guitar</a></h3>
<p><b>Author:</b> Kreg Segall<br />
<b>Players:</b> 15-50</p>
<p>BLINK-179 is "OFF THE HOOK" - Here are some comments we've gotten from the
fan club headquarters site at AOL:</p>
<p>Hey blink179 - I really had a great time at the dig y'all did @ my crib omfg
you guys are loud you might remember me I was the girl with the red shirt and u
looked at me during the last song do you have a gf write back cya! :O)</p>

complicated, Brains cuz he's deep n Manley cuz hes a lil hottie! I don't like
Stu though he su&gt;&lt;ors. OK bye.</p>
<p>Blink-179 is an up and coming new alternative punkpop bank with a serious
problem. Tomorrow begins their world tour, but their lead guitarist, Eddie
"Razorbutt" Nelson has left the band to join Destiny's Child. Without a lead
guitarist, there'll be no tour, and without a tour, the band will lose the fame
they've worked so hard to achieve. The choice is clear. It's time for open
auditions. Announcements were placed in every local newspaper. A room was
reserved at the local college. Now all they have to do is listen to all of the
guitarists who responded to the ad, and make a difficult selection from what is
sure to be dozens of qualified professionals.</p>
<p><i>Shut Up and Play Your Guitar</i> is a comedy horde-style game. The band
members will play the same parts throughout, while the horde members will play
the assorted freaks and weirdos who show up at the audition.</p>

Fair from the Evil Two-Headed Owner of the Terror Dome. Or, you can be the Evil,
Two-Headed Owner... or any of the multitude of beings in between. And, the best
part is, the bigger a ham you are, the better! Think <i>Flesh Gordon</i>...

Tomatoes</i>. Now cheese it up a bit more, and you have <i>Slave Girls of the
Terror Dome</i>.</p>
